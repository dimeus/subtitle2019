1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,570
Kenichi...

2
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,360
Hideki...

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,270
Minoru...

4
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,490
Masao...

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,360
Susumu...

6
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,660
Yuta...

7
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,770
Yaichi..

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,910
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,790
Isao...

10
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,960
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,710
Yukio...

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,420
Takahiro...

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,940
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,220
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,620
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,670
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,340
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,170
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,660
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,220
MUGEN

23
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,340
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,060
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,840
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,820
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,020
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,660
We should go, too!

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,860
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,910
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,360
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,690
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,790
So fast!

34
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,790
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,610
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,810
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,720
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,610
Thank you.

39
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,060
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,870
Oh no.

41
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,410
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,160
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,790
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,070
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,170
Sure,

46
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,220
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,470
Hey!

48
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,890
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
Delicious!

- Delicious!
- Yeah.

Delicious!

71
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,140
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,910
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,990
Yes.

74
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,770
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,660
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,690
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,910
Yes.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,010
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,670
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,090
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,340
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,110
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,770
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,440
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,270
A mission?

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,710
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,290
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,910
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,040
Right.

90
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,070
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,260
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,220
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,920
About my father...

94
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,970
What about your father?

95
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,670
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,010
Was he really?

97
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,490
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,190
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,490
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,910
The thing is...

101
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,910
What's up?

102
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,020
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,570
Dance!

104
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,440
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,370
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,210
Right!

108
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,620
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,860
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,470
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,860
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,940
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,770
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,460
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,410
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,990
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,620
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,070
Flame.

119
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,370
Water.

120
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,660
Wind.

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,970
Stone.

122
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,090
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,720
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,970
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,970
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,110
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,610
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,660
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,660
For real?

131
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,310
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,670
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,620
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,420
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,920
No, thank you!

136
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,370
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,270
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,190
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,890
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,790
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,710
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,460
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Sure do!

146
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,890
What? They do?

147
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,560
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,310
Nooo!

149
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,060
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,590
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,160
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,070
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,160
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,260
May I...

155
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,840
see your...

156
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,710
tickets, please?

157
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,120
What's he doing?

158
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,560
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,940
Here.

160
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,420
What is this?

161
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,840
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,090
Thank you...

163
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,260
very much.

164
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,860
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,990
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,490
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,340
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,810
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,270
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,220
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,460
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,460
First Form...

173
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,090
Amazing.

174
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,590
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,590
There's still one more.

176
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,270
Come with me!

177
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,570
All right!

178
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,520
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,010
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,940
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,860
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,360
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
All right!

184
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,770
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,810
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,370
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,840
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,260
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,260
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,360
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,360
Second Form...

192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,020
Rising Scorching Sun!

193
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,540
Tha...

194
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,540
Tha...

195
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,470
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

196
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,310
Please make me your apprentice!

197
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,110
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

198
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,110
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

199
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,640
I'll train all of you!

200
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,560
Big Bro Rengoku!

201
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,060
Bro!

202
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,120
- Bro!
- Bro!

203
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,990
Big Bro Rengoku!

204
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,360
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

205
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,290
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

206
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,760
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

207
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,420
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,710
I'm begging you.

209
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,620
Sure thing.

210
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,110
You did a good job.

211
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Go to sleep.

212
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,310
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

213
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,610
Excuse me.

214
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,790
What do you want us to do?

215
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,790
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

216
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,460
Wait here until then.

217
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,590
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

218
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,060
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

219
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,560
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

220
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,470
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

221
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,990
so that you can have blissful dreams.

222
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,160
Okay.

223
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,210
What's going on? What happened?

224
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,840
Calm down.

225
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,720
Calm down.

226
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,170
You have to calm down.

227
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,570
Hey!

228
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,570
It's Big Bro!

229
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,740
Welcome home, Big Bro!

230
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,660
Did you sell the charcoal?

231
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,340
Big Bro?

232
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,440
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

233
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,910
To be able to die while dreaming...

234
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,460
Just how lucky are you?

235
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,820
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

236
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,120
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

237
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,640
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

238
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,010
You can kill them just like that!

239
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,310
All human hearts are the same.

240
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,520
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

241
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,740
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

242
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,070
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

243
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,420
Take a deep, slow breath...

244
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,340
while you count.

245
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,340
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

246
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,120
One...

247
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,510
Two...

248
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,190
Three...

249
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,110
Four...

250
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Five...

251
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,940
Six...

252
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,390
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

253
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,290
What a weirdo!

254
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,410
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

255
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,740
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

256
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,320
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?

257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,340
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

258
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,340
I'm all right.

259
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,840
Are you sure?

260
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,390
Hey! You come back here!

261
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,060
Gotcha!

262
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,220
What do you think you're doing?

263
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,220
Hey! You stop that right now!

264
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,020
I was having a bad dream or something.

265
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,990
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,360
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

267
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,120
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

268
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,540
Looks like fun.

269
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,120
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

270
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,870
You are falling...

271
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,390
You are falling...,

272
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,640
into a dream.

273
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
It's a deep slumber.

274
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,640
They can...

275
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,740
no longer awaken.

276
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,410
LOWER ONE

277
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,990
This way!

278
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,120
The peaches over here taste great!

279
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,560
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

280
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll make you a chaplet!

281
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,060
I can make these really great-looking ones...

282
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Nezuko!

283
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,390
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

284
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,760
Zenitsu?

285
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,070
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

286
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,320
River?

287
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,570
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

288
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,320
I can't swim.

289
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,340
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

290
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,340
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

291
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,840
Just leave it to me!

292
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,340
Let's go!

293
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,440
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,310
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,220
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,060
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

297
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,570
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

298
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,370
Boss!

299
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,620
Boss!

300
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,370
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

301
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,040
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

302
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,540
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

303
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,060
Here he is!

304
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,640
All right, let's go! Showdown!

305
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,510
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

306
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,090
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,340
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

308
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's go!

309
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,770
- Hey!
- Hey!

310
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,540
Why did I come here?

311
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,770
Oh, right.

312
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,270
To report to my father...

313
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,690
that I've become a Hashira.

314
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,870
So what if you've become a Hashira?

315
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,670
Worthless.

316
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,340
It means nothing.

317
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,340
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

318
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,640
'Neither you...

319
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,840
nor I.

320
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,270
Brother...

321
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,320
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

322
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,570
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

323
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,620
He wasn't always like that.

324
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,210
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

325
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,090
He was a passionate man.

326
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,420
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

327
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,790
Suddenly.

328
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,270
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

329
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,310
Why?

330
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,270
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

331
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,540
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

332
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,370
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

333
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,790
and just look at the state our father is in.

334
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,390
I'm going to be honest.

335
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,840
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

336
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,510
He told me that it meant nothing.

337
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

338
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,010
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

339
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,020
I'll never give in!

340
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,020
And Senjuro...

341
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,770
You're not like me.

342
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,240
ou have a big brother...

343
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,270
who believes in his little brother.

344
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,120
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

345
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

346
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,760
Let's do our best!

347
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,960
Let's do our best-and live on!

348
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,260
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

349
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,970
Looking good.

350
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Those ropes that I created are used...

351
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,860
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

352
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,190
I always fight with the utmost caution.

353
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,540
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

354
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,910
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

355
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,470
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

356
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,590
Relax your shoulders.

357
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,260
Like this?

358
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
That's right.

359
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,470
Close call. He's right there.

360
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,520
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

361
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,110
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

362
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,020
Hurry!

363
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,240
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

364
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,410
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

365
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,340
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

366
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,260
That's what you must destroy.

367
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,010
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

368
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,520
There it is!

369
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,020
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

370
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,360
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

371
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,160
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

372
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,240
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

373
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,970
It's hot,

374
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,510
It's burning up.

375
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,810
I have to hurry.

376
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,360
Found it!

377
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,410
The spiritual core!

378
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,660
I've never seen a red one before.

379
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,920
All I have to do is destroy this and...

380
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,710
It'll be my turn to...

381
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,640
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

382
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,490
What a strong survival instinct he has!

383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,910
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

384
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,570
Wow!

385
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,970
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

386
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,390
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

387
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,170
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

388
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,640
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

389
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,590
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

390
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,610
Can you get the grill ready for me?

391
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,160
Okay!

392
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,490
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

393
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,190
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

394
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,660
Me, too!

395
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,270
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

396
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,940
No fair!

397
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,370
There.

398
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,590
Nezuko, let's go.

399
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,940
What did I just say?

400
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,110
I'm back!

401
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,720
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

402
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,910
Yeah, I'm home!

403
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,540
Welcome home, Big Bro!

404
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,660
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

405
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,660
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

406
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,070
In broad daylight?

407
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,010
She's not supposed to?

408
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,420
Well...

409
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,890
Um...

410
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,090
Tanjiro...

411
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,170
Could you get the bath ready?

412
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,010
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

413
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,560
I keep saying all these strange things.

414
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,440
Am I tired maybe?

415
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,440
tis.gone.

416
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,020
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

417
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,870
A toolbox perhaps?

418
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,010
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

419
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,710
Wake up!

420
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,210
Wake up!

421
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,310
Wake up!

422
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,140
You're under attack!

423
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,390
It's a dream!

424
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,890
This is a dream!

425
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,390
I see... That's right, I'm...

426
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,560
on board the train!

427
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,410
Wake up and fight!

428
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,910
Fight!

429
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,790
Fight!

430
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,320
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

431
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,910
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

432
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,510
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

433
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,920
What's your problem?

434
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,760
You just had seconds!

435
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,010
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

436
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,340
How can I get out of it?

437
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,510
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

438
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,520
What am I supposed to do?

439
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,090
I have to wake up...

440
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,290
Big Bro!

441
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,410
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

442
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,260
Nezuko...

443
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,510
Nezuko!

444
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,390
My uniform...

445
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,840
My Nichirin Sword...

446
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,060
I'm waking up!

447
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,670
Little by little.

448
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,360
Little by little!

449
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,240
Big Bro?

450
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,410
Big Bro, are you all right?

451
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,610
Big Bro?

452
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,660
Sorry.

453
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,360
I have to go.

454
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,190
I have to hurry back!

455
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,210
I'm sorry.

456
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,620
Big Bro!

457
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,370
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

458
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,590
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

459
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,560
I have to find him and slash him right away!

460
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,610
Where is he? I have to...

461
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,140
Where are you going, Big Bro?

462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,040
I picked lots of vegetables today!

463
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,210
Mom! This way!

464
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,210
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

465
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,540
Mom?

466
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,320
Tanjiro, are you all right?

467
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,670
Big Bro...

468
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,220
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

469
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,270
I wish I could stay here...

470
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,070
forever.

471
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,460
I wish I could turn around and go back,

472
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,960
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

473
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,870
Right here.

474
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
If none of this had happened...

475
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,260
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

476
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:28,640
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

477
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,890
If none of this had happened...

478
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,390
I should be here
making charcoal every day

479
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,910
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

480
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,820
If none of this had happened...

481
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,240
f none of this had happenedos

482
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,560
But I've lost them now.

483
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,760
I can never go back!

484
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,670
Big Bro!

485
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,690
Don't leave us behind!

486
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,110
Sorry!

487
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,740
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

488
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,360
We can't be together anymore.

489
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,840
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

490
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,420
I'll be thinking of you all!

491
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,290
There are lots of things to thank you for.

492
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,770
Lots of things to be sorry for!

493
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,160
But I will never forget you!

494
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,890
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

495
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,890
So, please...

496
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,390
forgive me!

497
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,070
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

498
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,810
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

499
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,310
How can it be so beautiful?

500
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,820
It's so endlessly vast...

501
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,610
and...

502
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,610
also warm.

503
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,840
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

504
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,870
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

505
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,120
And that creepy naked boar...

506
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,710
Seriously, this is insane.

507
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,470
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

508
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,140
You stupid naked boar!

509
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,910
It's pitch-dark.

510
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,660
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

511
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,410
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

512
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,590
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

513
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,670
You must be kidding me.

514
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,390
What was that?

515
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,610
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

516
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,360
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

517
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,770
Where's Nezuko?

518
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,620
Wh-Who the heck knows?

519
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,620
All right, then... Die!

520
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,290
Nooo!

521
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,620
They're having trouble, aren't they?

522
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,520
I wonder why.

523
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,640
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

524
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,890
Oh well...

525
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,390
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

526
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,410
Not here.

527
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,120
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

528
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,990
What's this, though?

529
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,410
It's like there's a film over everything!

530
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,160
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

531
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,410
I can't tell the exact location!

532
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,460
I have to hurry!

533
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,920
Nezuko's bleeding!

534
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,170
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

535
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,090
What should I do?

536
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,060
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

537
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,560
Am I just asleep right now?

538
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,940
Tanjiro...

539
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,160
Take up your sword.

540
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,820
There's something you must cut.

541
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,120
There's something...

542
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,510
I must cut.

543
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,090
There's something I must cut...

544
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,120
in order to wake up.

545
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,220
I think I know what it is.

546
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,020
But what if I'm wrong?

547
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,270
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

548
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,270
there'll be no going back.

549
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,270
Don't hesitate! Do it!

550
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,910
You have to do it!

551
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,870
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

552
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,490
In other words...

553
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,160
what I have to cut is...

554
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,620
my own neck!

555
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm all right. I'm alive.

556
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,320
Nezuko! Are you okay?

557
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,860
Nezuko...

558
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,940
Zenitsu...

559
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,740
Inosuke...

560
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,670
Rengoku...

561
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,840
Who are these people?

562
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,340
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

563
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,020
Rope...

564
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,670
What's this?

565
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,390
It's burned off.

566
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,860
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

567
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,860
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

568
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,020
This smell... The ticket!

569
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,060
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

570
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,160
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

571
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,070
This must be a demon's work!

572
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,620
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

573
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,570
I don't know why...

574
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,510
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

575
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,310
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

576
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,670
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

577
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,660
Zenitsu! Wake up!

578
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,910
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

579
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,770
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

580
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,020
Inosuke...

581
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,270
There, there... Sorry, okay?

582
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,920
Thanks.

583
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,790
You did a great job, Nezuko.

584
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,790
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

585
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,040
What can I do?

586
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,840
Rengoku

587
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,470
What are you doing?

588
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,470
Is a demon controlling her?

589
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,270
Get out of our way!

590
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,360
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

591
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,540
Is she acting of her own free will?

592
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,910
This man, too?

593
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,960
What do you think you're doing?

594
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,820
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

595
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,890
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

596
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,090
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

597
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,720
Is he the one who was connected to me?

598
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,560
Tuberculosis...

599
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,220
He's sick.

600
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,220
Poor man.

601
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,240
What this demon did is unforgivable.

602
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,320
He took advantage of their weak souls!

603
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:57,410
Sorry.

604
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,910
I have to go fight.

605
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,110
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

606
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,490
I was willing...

607
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:53,710
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

608
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,710
But it was warm...

609
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,470
inside your dream and inside your soul.

610
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,470
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

611
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,240
Is that his spiritual core?

612
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,240
Why are you showing it to me?

613
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,370
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

614
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,710
No way!

615
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,040
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

616
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,340
Why would you...

617
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,390
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

618
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,470
Are you all right?

619
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,220
Thank you.

620
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,610
Be careful.

621
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,710
Right!

622
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,120
Nezuko!

623
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,920
The smell is overpowering!

624
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,170
So heavy!

625
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,170
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

626
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,170
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

627
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,810
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

628
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,670
I can't believe I was!

629
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,520
I was useless!

630
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,910
The demon's upwind...

631
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,690
Is he in the first car?

632
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,820
Nezuko, don't come!

633
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,820
Stay away from me and wait!

634
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,990
Go wake everyone up!

635
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,090
What? You're awake?

636
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,920
Good morning!

637
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,010
You could've stayed asleep.

638
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,510
It was him!

639
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,440
Why did you wake up?

640
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,440
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

641
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:28,440
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

642
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,220
Would you have liked that one better?

643
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,870
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

644
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,660
All right, next...

645
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,910
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

646
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,170
What I really love..,

647
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:01,170
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

648
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,690
I get such a kick out of that!

649
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:17,940
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

650
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,440
But I don't usually let my guard down.

651
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,460
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

652
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,670
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

653
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:36,210
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

654
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,510
the spell activates,

655
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,310
And yet...

656
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,360
how did this one manage to wake up?

657
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,220
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

658
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:59,660
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

659
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,290
is so enormous!

660
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,490
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

661
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
I won't let you...

662
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,960
get away with this!

663
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,170
How lucky is that?

664
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,720
So, he came right to me!

665
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,420
This is like a dream!

666
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,990
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

667
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:40,110
And once I become more powerful,

668
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,990
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

669
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,290
Water Breathing...

670
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,960
Tenth Form...

671
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,460
Constant Flux!

672
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,670
Blood Demon Art!

673
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,440
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

674
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,440
Go to sleep!

675
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,470
He's not falling asleep.

676
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,120
Go to sleep.

677
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,620
Go to sleep.

678
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,010
Go to sleep!

679
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,470
Go... to... sleep!

680
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,760
It's not working. But why not?

681
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,820
He's falling under this spell over and over!

682
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,740
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

683
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:27,510
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

684
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,370
to take his own life with his own hands...

685
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,140
that takes incredible willpower!

686
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,060
This brat...

687
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,970
is insane!

688
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,460
Why didn't you save us?

689
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,320
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

690
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,090
How could you be the only one to survive?

691
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,670
Why do you think you were here?

692
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,090
You're so useless!

693
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,820
It should've been you that died.

694
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,190
How dare you go on living
without a care.

695
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,960
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

696
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,340
Don't you dare...

697
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,290
insult...

698
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,420
my family!

699
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,120
It was way too easy.

700
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,710
Could this be a dream, too?

701
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:29,070
Or was this demon weaker than him?

702
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,070
I can totally see why...

703
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,670
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

704
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,840
along with the Hashira!

705
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,340
Your very existence is, like...

706
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,670
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

707
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,440
He's not dying?

708
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,610
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

709
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,020
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

710
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:04,770
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

711
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:09,370
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

712
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,840
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

713
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,870
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

714
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,370
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

715
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,390
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

716
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,890
While you were snoozing away...

717
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,770
I fused with this train!

718
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:42,910
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

719
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,460
Look at your face.

720
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,660
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

721
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,790
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

722
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,710
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

723
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,170
as well as my hostages.

724
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,720
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

725
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:09,920
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

726
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,240
What should I do? What should I do?

727
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,940
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

728
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,660
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

729
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,870
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

730
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,510
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

731
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,420
Nezuko!

732
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,260
Protect the sleeping passengers!

733
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,890
Follow me, damn minions!

734
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,220
All right!

735
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,440
Explosive Awakening!

736
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,640
Comin' through!

737
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,410
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

738
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,660
Inosuke!

739
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,160
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

740
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,410
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

741
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,160
This whole train's turned into a demon!

742
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,410
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

743
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,970
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

744
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,970
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

745
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,220
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

746
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,720
Crazy Cutting!

747
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,740
I'll save every last one of you guys!

748
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,800
Fall onto your knees...

749
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,990
and worship me!

750
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,990
Glorify me!

751
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:58,320
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

752
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,090
I have to go save the passengers!

753
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,170
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

754
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,690
It's gone this far already?

755
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,960
Water Breathing...

756
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,820
First Form...

757
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,120
Water Surface Slash!

758
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,660
No good.

759
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,990
This is never going to end!

760
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,320
How am I supposed to fend it off?

761
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:01,340
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

762
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,170
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

763
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:09,270
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

764
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,640
Thunder Breathing...

765
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,760
First Form...

766
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,860
Thunderclap and Flash!

767
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,110
Sixfold.

768
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,860
I'll protect you...

769
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,110
Nezuko!

770
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,360
Protect...

771
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,790
That sounded like thunder,

772
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,620
From one of the cars in the back?

773
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,590
What's going on?

774
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,460
Is Zenitsu awake now?

775
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,420
What about Rengoku?

776
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,710
And Nezuko?

777
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:12,390
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

778
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,720
This is bad! What should I do?

779
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,360
We can't fight in coordination!

780
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,610
Are the passengers in the back all right?

781
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,020
Damn!

782
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,890
It's so cramped!

783
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:25,710
And so hard to swing my sword!

784
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,210
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

785
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,790
How could this be?

786
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,720
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

787
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,560
If only I could crawl...

788
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,220
under a rock!

789
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,390
What happened?

790
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,940
What was that?

791
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,570
A demon attack?

792
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,360
Young Kamado!

793
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,360
Rengoku!

794
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,090
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

795
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:18,710
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

796
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,290
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

797
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,210
Okay!

798
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,460
This train has eight cars in all.

799
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,710
I'll protect the five in the rear.

800
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,960
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

801
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,860
You and the boar head boy...

802
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,770
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

803
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,060
Head?

804
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,520
But this demon is

805
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:43,310
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

806
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:45,720
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

807
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,860
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

808
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,910
Amazing! I can't even see him!

809
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,290
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

810
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,790
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

811
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,040
Five cars, all by himself?

812
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:08,140
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

813
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:12,010
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

814
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,260
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

815
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,390
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

816
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,520
But somehow...

817
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,520
Somehow...

818
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,270
Somehow, he was awesome!

819
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,110
I'm so pissed!

820
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:36,740
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

821
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,570
You don't have to tell me!

822
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:42,010
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

823
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:44,010
With my all-out Seventh Form...

824
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,120
I found this master's weak spot!

825
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,540
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

826
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,040
That's right, up front!

827
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,870
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

828
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:57,870
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

829
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,220
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

830
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,770
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

831
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,810
That's right!

832
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:04,720
Understood!

833
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,860
Okay, let's go!

834
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,360
Forward!

835
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,870
This is it, huh?

836
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,210
All right!

837
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:35,670
Inosuke!

838
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,920
Fishy, very fishy!

839
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,310
Especially around here!

840
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,670
Who the hell are you?

841
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:44,670
G-Get out of here!

842
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,670
The demon's head...

843
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,170
The demon's...

844
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,940
weak spot!

845
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,070
Gross!

846
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,410
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

847
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,320
That's way too many hands!

848
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:03,860
Uh-oh!

849
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:09,620
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

850
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,120
Whirlpool!

851
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,760
Inosuke, are you all right?

852
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,260
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

853
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,270
Yeah, I know!

854
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,220
It's here...

855
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:30,690
It's right beneath!

856
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,860
Directly below this place.

857
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,610
The demon's scent is powerful!

858
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,240
Just watch.

859
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,370
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

860
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,490
Slice!

861
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,990
It's the bone.

862
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,890
His neck bone!

863
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,340
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

864
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,670
Waterfall Basin!

865
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,510
It blocked it!

866
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,240
The gash is closing up!

867
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,520
It's regenerating so fast!

868
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:34,210
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

869
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,290
I have to sever it!

870
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:40,120
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

871
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,870
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

872
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,590
Sounds good! Great idea!

873
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,120
I can praise you for that!

874
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,270
Thanks!

875
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,190
Let's go!

876
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,560
DREAM

877
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:05,310
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

878
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,820
A Blood Demon Art!

879
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:10,490
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

880
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,870
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

881
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,240
Then, you'll wake up!

882
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,070
It's all right!

883
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,470
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

884
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:30,470
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

885
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,680
Okay, I'm awake!

886
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,190
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

887
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,020
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

888
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,820
With my eyes shut!

889
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,610
No good!

890
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,940
Wake up!

891
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,690
Wake up!

892
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:55,690
Hurry!

893
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,190
Cut the neck!

894
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,210
Cut it! Cut it!

895
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,290
I have to wake up!

896
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,460
Hurry!

897
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,120
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

898
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,360
Don't fall for his trap!

899
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,890
Don't die such lame deaths!

900
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,390
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

901
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,560
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

902
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,690
You loser eyeballs!

903
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:36,740
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

904
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,820
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

905
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,240
Inosuke!

906
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,640
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

907
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,170
Did you get stabbed?

908
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,560
I'm okay.

909
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,010
Just forget about that bastard!

910
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,510
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

911
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:11,360
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

912
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,820
I know! Let's get moving!

913
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,010
Inosuke!

914
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,170
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

915
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,040
And let's chop off the demon's head!

916
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,920
Let's attack together!

917
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,890
No good! If I fall asleep now...

918
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,390
Damn you!

919
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,890
C'mon! Follow me!

920
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,890
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

921
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,590
Slice 'n' Dice!

922
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,940
Father, please protect me!

923
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,520
I'm going to sever that bone...

924
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,570
with this blow!

925
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,690
Hinokami Kagura...

926
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,360
Clear Blue Sky!

927
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,810
Are you okay, Inosuke?

928
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,720
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

929
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,060
Y-Yeah!

930
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,690
Inosuke, protect the passen

931
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:21,770
I can't die.

932
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,320
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

933
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,740
I can't die!

934
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,540
I don't want to let anyone die!

935
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,740
Are you okay, Santaro?

936
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,740
Hang in there!

937
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,690
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

938
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,610
Cool, huh?

939
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,520
Is your belly okay?

940
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,570
Your belly that got stabbed!

941
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:15,920
I'm...

942
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,870
all right.

943
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,620
What about you?

944
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,040
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

945
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,620
I won't be able to move for a while.

946
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,540
Help the others, will you?

947
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,970
Was anyone injured?

948
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,610
What about the engineer near the head?

949
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:43,110
It's okay if that bastard dies!

950
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,560
It's not okay.

951
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,190
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

952
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:51,620
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

953
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,320
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

954
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,790
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

955
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:59,910
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

956
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:02,370
Help him, will you?

957
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:05,620
Please.

958
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:14,560
I'll go for you, then!

959
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,220
Because I'm the boss!

960
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,470
Because my minion asked me to!

961
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,890
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

962
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,820
That's really not necessary.

963
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,410
It's almost dawn.

964
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,820
Get your breathing under control.

965
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,070
We have to...

966
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,090
save the injured...

967
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,210
before it's too late.

968
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,940
My body's disintegrating.

969
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,060
I can't regenerate,

970
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:10,140
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

971
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,320
Me?

972
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,940
Ridiculous.

973
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,960
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

974
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:20,460
I couldn't devour a single human!

975
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:25,960
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

976
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:28,960
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

977
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,510
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

978
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,470
It was him!

979
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,590
It's all his fault!

980
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:42,420
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

981
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,890
I was held at bay!

982
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,720
Is this the power of a Hashira?

983
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,070
And him... He was fast, too.

984
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,520
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

985
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:58,070
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

986
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,440
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

987
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,740
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

988
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:07,760
Dammit! Dammit!

989
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,540
In the first place...

990
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,290
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

991
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,040
That brat is to blame!

992
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,870
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

993
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,790
That's right, and that boar, too!

994
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,640
I could've at least killed that brat!

995
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,860
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

996
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:34,060
He could sense my gaze!

997
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,140
Am I going to lose?

998
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,440
Am I going to die?

999
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,820
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

1000
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:50,820
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

1001
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,490
In the Upper Ranks...

1002
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:56,210
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

1003
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:01,170
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

1004
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:04,170
Do they have otherworldly powers?

1005
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:10,060
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1006
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,240
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1007
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:20,910
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1008
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,740
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1009
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,710
Impressive!

1010
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,370
Rengoku...

1011
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,840
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1012
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,210
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1013
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,870
I'll do my best.

1014
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,760
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1015
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:51,560
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1016
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,060
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1017
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,060
There's a blood vessel.

1018
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,110
A torn blood vessel.

1019
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,440
Concentrate harder!

1020
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,170
Focus!

1021
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,170
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1022
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:42,110
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1023
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,770
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

1024
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:49,190
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1025
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,940
Right.

1026
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,090
Everyone's safe!

1027
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:58,290
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1028
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,120
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1029
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,040
Thank you very much.

1030
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,320
Upper... Three?

1031
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,040
What's he doing here and now?

1032
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:58,970
Flame Breathing, Second Form...

1033
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:02,890
Rising Scorching Sun!

1034
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,740
That's a fine sword.

1035
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,520
He sure can regenerate fast.

1036
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:21,240
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1037
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,990
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1038
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,540
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1039
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:32,870
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1040
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,460
What would you and I have to talk about?

1041
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:39,870
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1042
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:44,270
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1043
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:47,220
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1044
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,810
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1045
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,060
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1046
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:58,910
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1047
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,410
I will not.

1048
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,240
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1049
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,870
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1050
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,660
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1051
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,320
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1052
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:15,510
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1053
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,970
I'm Akaza.

1054
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,310
Kyojuro...

1055
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,470
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1056
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,310
Because you're a human.

1057
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,590
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1058
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:33,740
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1059
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:39,160
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1060
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,740
You can become stronger.

1061
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:47,240
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1062
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,510
I have to help him fight!

1063
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:56,960
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1064
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:00,510
The fact that we grow old and die

1065
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:04,010
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1066
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:10,110
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1067
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:16,270
This boy isn't weak!

1068
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,390
Don't insult him.

1069
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,440
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1070
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,710
You and I have different senses of value.

1071
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:29,290
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1072
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,790
I see.

1073
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,570
Technique Development...

1074
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,640
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1075
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,870
I can't follow their movements!

1076
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,790
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1077
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:25,540
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1078
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:31,870
Why do you think that is?

1079
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,190
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1080
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:40,110
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1081
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:49,490
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1082
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,820
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1083
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,570
Die, Kyojuro...

1084
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,660
while you're still young and strong.

1085
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,570
Destructive Death..

1086
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,160
Air Type!

1087
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,420
I see.

1088
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,470
Flame Breathing...

1089
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,970
Fourth Form...

1090
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,070
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1091
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,410
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1092
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,940
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1093
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:46,840
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1094
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,090
In that case...

1095
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:54,790
I'll just have to get up close!

1096
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,440
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1097
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,390
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1098
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,970
Kyojuro!

1099
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,470
Doesn't that make you sad?

1100
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,890
It happens to everyone!

1101
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,360
It's a fact of life for any human!

1102
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,360
Stay where you are!

1103
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,660
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1104
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,240
Stand back! That's an order!

1105
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,620
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1106
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,490
Come on, give me your best shot!

1107
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,490
Concentrate on me.

1108
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,260
Nice moves!

1109
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,740
Rengoku!

1110
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,110
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1111
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,360
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1112
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,490
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1113
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,840
You have what it takes to do that!

1114
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,090
I'll pass!

1115
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:18,790
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1116
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,560
I will not become a demon!

1117
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,470
Blazing Universe!

1118
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,390
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1119
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,440
Destructive Death..

1120
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,540
Air Type!

1121
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,490
There's no opening.

1122
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:51,990
I can't jump in.

1123
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:54,870
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1124
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,640
Those two are in a different dimension!

1125
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:02,010
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1126
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,010
I can't move...

1127
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,920
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1128
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,390
Rengoku...

1129
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,440
You still don't get it?

1130
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:24,110
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1131
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:35,170
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1132
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:36,460
Unknowing Fire!

1133
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:41,090
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1134
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,790
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1135
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,770
Second Form...

1136
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,810
Rising Scorching Sun!

1137
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,490
Third Form...

1138
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,210
Blazing Universe!

1139
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:17,710
Fourth Form...

1140
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,040
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1141
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,170
Destructive Death..

1142
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:26,760
Fifth Form...

1143
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,470
Flame Tiger!

1144
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,560
Disorder!

1145
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:39,170
Kyojuro!

1146
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,290
Did he do it? Did he win?

1147
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,360
Don't tell me...

1148
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:36,410
No way!

1149
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,410
Let's fight more.

1150
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,590
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1151
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:09,360
Rengoku!

1152
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,270
Rengoku!

1153
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:24,510
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1154
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:31,960
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1155
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,290
But what about you?

1156
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:39,260
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1157
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,470
All irreparable.

1158
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:44,610
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1159
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:48,360
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1160
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:52,560
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1161
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:57,060
I want to go help him!

1162
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:02,240
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1163
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,660
It's partly because of my injury,

1164
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,710
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1165
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,420
Kyojuro, why...

1166
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,420
I will fulfill my duty!

1167
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,070
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1168
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,910
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1169
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,320
Flame Breathing...

1170
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:50,510
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1171
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:53,420
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1172
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:55,420
That mental strength!

1173
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,420
That airtight stance!

1174
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:04,420
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1175
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,690
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1176
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,520
Set your heart ablaze.

1177
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:12,270
Go beyond your limits!

1178
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:19,440
Ninth Form...

1179
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:21,890
Rengoku!

1180
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,410
Destructive Death..

1181
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:25,040
Annihilation Type!

1182
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,420
Rengoku!

1183
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,840
Rengoku!

1184
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:24,590
Rengoku!

1185
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,260
I see hi

1186
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,340
Ren...

1187
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,710
goku...

1188
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,690
Become a demon!

1189
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:48,690
Say that you'll become a demon!

1190
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:49,960
You are...

1191
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:53,320
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1192
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,470
Kyojuro...

1193
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,220
Yes, Mother?

1194
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,260
I want you to think hard...

1195
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:14,890
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1196
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:20,840
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1197
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:26,110
I don't know!

1198
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,610
So that you can save weaker people.

1199
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:36,190
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1200
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:42,120
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1201
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:50,870
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1202
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,090
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1203
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:02,110
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1204
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:06,610
Make sure you never forget that.

1205
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:08,140
I won't!

1206
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:28,710
I don't have much more time to live.

1207
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:34,420
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1208
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:38,260
I will entrust everything to you.

1209
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,570
Mother...

1210
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:57,990
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1211
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:07,120
He stopped it?

1212
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,920
What unbelievable strength!

1213
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,120
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1214
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,260
Damn!

1215
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,090
It'll be daybreak soon!

1216
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,420
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1217
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:23,720
I can't...

1218
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:25,020
pull my arm out!

1219
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,470
I won't let you escape!

1220
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,560
No matter what Rengoku says...

1221
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,290
I have to...

1222
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:43,990
do it right now!

1223
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:47,960
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1224
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,490
Quickly!

1225
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:54,040
The sun's coming up!

1226
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:56,790
There'll be sunlight here!

1227
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,310
I have to get away!

1228
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:14,820
Not until I chop off your head!

1229
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:26,410
Move, Inosuke!

1230
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:30,070
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1231
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:36,170
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1232
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,210
Pierce!

1233
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:59,720
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1234
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:11,490
That took too long!

1235
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:13,660
I have to get away from the sun!

1236
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,370
Don't run away!

1237
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,810
Don't run away, you coward!

1238
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,920
Don't run away!

1239
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:32,560
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1240
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,170
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1241
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,840
I'm not running away from you!

1242
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:40,440
I'm running away from the sun!

1243
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:43,690
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1244
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:47,360
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1245
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:51,610
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1246
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:56,170
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1247
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:58,290
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1248
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:00,710
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1249
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,540
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1250
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:06,370
Don't run away, you bastard!

1251
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,060
You bastard!

1252
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,120
You coward!

1253
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:14,720
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1254
01:41:14,730 --> 01:41:16,440
He's stronger!

1255
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:18,360
Rengoku didn't lose!

1256
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:20,640
He didn't let anybody die!

1257
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:24,270
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1258
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,390
You're the one who lost!

1259
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:30,220
It's Rengoku who won!

1260
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:07,160
Stop yelling already.

1261
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,820
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1262
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,520
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1263
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:20,910
If you die, young Kamado,

1264
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,540
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1265
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:27,010
Rengoku...

1266
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:29,710
Come over here.

1267
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:32,540
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1268
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,560
There's something that I remembered...

1269
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,440
while I was dreaming.

1270
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,290
You should go to my parents' home,

1271
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:02,540
the Rengoku residence.

1272
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:06,990
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1273
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,960
My father read them often,

1274
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:15,420
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1275
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:25,390
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1276
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:30,390
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1277
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:32,770
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1278
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,070
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1279
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:39,690
I'll be dead soon.

1280
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:45,360
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1281
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:49,370
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1282
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:52,040
to follow his heart...

1283
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:56,790
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1284
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:00,790
Tell my father...

1285
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:04,340
that I want him to take care of himself.

1286
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,610
One more thing.

1287
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:09,890
Young Kamado...

1288
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,890
I believe in your little sister.

1289
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,440
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1290
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:26,120
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1291
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:30,910
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1292
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:35,040
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1293
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,120
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1294
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:48,640
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1295
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,720
set your heart ablaze.

1296
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:57,140
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1297
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:01,690
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1298
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,660
the time won't wait for you...

1299
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:08,610
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1300
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,910
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1301
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:14,960
As a Hashira,

1302
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:18,170
of course I would shield my juniors.

1303
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:22,710
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1304
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:25,670
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1305
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,290
Young Kamado...

1306
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,560
Young Boar Head...

1307
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,860
Yellow Boy...

1308
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,470
Keep learning and grow.

1309
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,640
And then,

1310
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,640
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1311
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,470
I believe in you.

1312
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:50,040
I believe in you all.

1313
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,260
Mother...

1314
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:24,110
Do you think I did it right?

1315
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:29,910
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1316
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:32,320
and my duties?

1317
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:44,120
You made me proud.

1318
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,790
When the train went off the rails,

1319
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:25,870
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1320
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:30,790
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1321
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:34,340
I guess he did.

1322
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,140
I can't believe he's gone.

1323
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,420
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1324
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:42,640
Yeah.

1325
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,810
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1326
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,490
Was it that strong? I mean...

1327
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:51,070
Yeah.

1328
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:55,660
I'm so frustrated!

1329
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:59,740
As soon as I master one thing,

1330
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:05,190
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1331
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,670
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1332
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:15,170
I just can't make it there yet!

1333
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:20,120
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1334
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,440
Can I...

1335
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:29,470
ever become like Rengoku?

1336
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:42,240
Stop whining already!

1337
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:48,240
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1338
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:53,490
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1339
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:57,260
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1340
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:00,760
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1341
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,510
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1342
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:07,140
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1343
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,510
you still have to go on living!

1344
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,390
But you're crying, too.

1345
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:15,160
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1346
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:18,160
I'm not crying!

1347
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:31,420
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1348
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,120
Is that so...

1349
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:19,460
Rengoku...

1350
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:44,110
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1351
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,110
I don't believe it.

1352
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:00,210
Namu Amida Butsu.

1353
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:11,210
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1354
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:20,310
I see.

1355
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:34,670
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1356
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:37,660
did a great job, then.

1357
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:39,870
What a remarkable child.

1358
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:43,210
I'm not sad.

1359
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,540
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1360
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:52,720
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1361
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,920
in the land of the dead.

1362
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:17,020
Rengoku!

1363
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:31,420
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1364
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:37,590
What's more important than grief

1365
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:43,970
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1366
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:49,190
In time for the warmth and pain

1367
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:55,130
I thought it would always be like this

1368
01:52:55,130 --> 01:53:02,240
I envisioned our days-to come

1369
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:15,060
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1370
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:21,980
We met amidst a blazing journey

1371
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:27,870
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1372
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:35,360
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1373
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:40,940
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1374
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:49,540
With my resolve as the parting gift

1375
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:05,790
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1376
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:12,530
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1377
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:18,780
There will be even more as I grow older

1378
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:23,960
I never want to lose anything again

1379
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:29,910
By succumbing to the grief

1380
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:36,960
I might not feel pain anymore

1381
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:44,060
But your words, your wishes

1382
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:50,640
I swore to protect them to the end

1383
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:08,940
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1384
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:29,560
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1385
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:46,990
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1386
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:52,960
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1387
01:55:52,960 --> 01:56:00,460
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1388
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:05,610
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1389
01:56:06,730 --> 01:56:12,310
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1390
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,190
Lighting the flames in my heart

1391
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:30,060
Until I reach that distant future
