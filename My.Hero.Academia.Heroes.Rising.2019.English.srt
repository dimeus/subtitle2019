00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,839
It is the League of Villains!

5
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,604

00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,524
--That's hard!
--I'm going closer!

00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:20,748

8
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,627
Sorry!

00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:28,923

00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,807

11
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,559
You're too persistent!

12
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,484

13
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,903
Don't ask pointless questions.

14
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,490
Why are the heroes here?

15
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,617
The information was leaked...

16
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,953
Leaked? From where...?

17
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,205
Who knows...

18
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,208
They got past the pursuit team. Now--

19
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,335
You don't have to spell it out.

20
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,963
Leave it to me.

21
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:09,964
Endeavor!

22
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,758
The one who's moved up to number one, huh?

23
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,302
It's so late.

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,679
You're working hard!

00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,353

27
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,024
I'll run you over, Endeavor!

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,610

00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,006
Endeavor...

32
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,984
You were here?

33
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,196
Why didn't you give us a hand, Hawks?

34
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:19,408
I just got here, Endeavor.

35
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,244
What about the League guys?

36
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,289
They were all doubles
made with Twice's Quirk.

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,085
What's this?

38
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,046
A life-support system...?

39
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,466
To transport a new type of Nomu or something?

40
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,510
What did you say?!

41
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,598
What in the world are Shigaraki
and the others transporting...?

42
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,568
I was getting tired of waiting, Nine.

43
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,530
It was worth the wait.

44
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,827
The experiment was a success.

45
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,219
The world has become a superhuman society,

46
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,722
and about 80% of the world's population
now has some kind of special trait.

I, Izuku Midoriya, was Quirkless,

51
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:33,274
but then I had a fateful meeting with All Might,

52
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,652

And then, I enrolled in the
hero course at U.A. High School,

55
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,158
And then, I enrolled in the
hero course at U.A. High School,

56
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,245
the prestigious school
that has produced many heroes...

57
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:50,749
I continue to run toward my dream.

58
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,209
That's right,

59
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:57,840

I became the greatest hero.

00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,199
--What the heck?!
--I-It won't come off!

64
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,993

65
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,828

66
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,122
--Thanks!
--You saved us!

00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,254
You're Katsuma Shimano, right?

179
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,173
A hero...

180
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,885
You got separated from your big sister, right?

181
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,220
Now, come with me--

182
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,514
You're late! That took too long!

183
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,267
--Mahoro...
--What's your name?

184
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,185
D-Deku...

185
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,313
Um, who are you?

186
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,566
Katsuma's big sister, Mahoro!

187
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,904
Huh? Then you found your little brother already?

188
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,030
That's great.

189
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,698
That's not great at all!

190
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,035
"Stopwatch"
Why did it take over an hour
to find a lost kid? Explain yourself!

191
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:23,076
"Stopwatch"

192
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,954
You're part of that famous
U.A.'s hero course, but you're useless.

193
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,792
If this is what we get, then maybe that
grandpa hero we had before'd be better!

194
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,045
I-I'm sorry...

195
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,381
Well, I guess it can't be helped,
since you're still a high schooler.

196
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,675
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

197
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,011
Deku?

198
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,140
Next time, make sure you do
your hero job properly, okay, Deku?

199
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,518
R-Right, I'll be more careful next time...

200
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,062
Let's go, Katsuma.

201
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,898
O-Okay...

202
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,735
U-Um...

203
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,364
Thanks...

204
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,408
You don't have to thank him!

205
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,827
Deku, what's going on?

206
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,580
What are you apologizing for?

207
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,335
I got scolded for taking
too long finding a lost kid.

208
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,004
Huh? What the heck?

209
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,382
But I'm glad...

210
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,967
About what?

211
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,929
That Katsuma was able
to get back to his sister safely.

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,434
Deku, you really feel like Deku, huh?

213
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,645
Huh? What do you mean?

214
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,315
That you're a hero through and through!

215
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,359
"Nabu Corner Store" "Restrooms"

216
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,653
"Nabu Corner Store" "Restrooms"
Those heroes were useless, like I thought.

217
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:39,861
Those heroes were useless, like I thought.

218
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,366
It's not like a small island like this
has any crime in the first place.

219
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm sure they're probably especially bad,
even for U.A. students.

220
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,332
They came to look for me, though.

221
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,128
That boy was definitely a hero.

222
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,677
Hmph. Then I'll be the one
to unmask who he really is!

223
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:07,889
Mahoro?!

224
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,349
"At the same time"

225
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
"At the same time"
I wonder if the Class A students
are being proper heroes...

226
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,603
I wonder if the Class A students
are being proper heroes...

227
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,939
The population of Nabu Island is 1,000.

228
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,317
In the last 30 years,
they've only had trivial crimes.

229
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,903
Anyway, I'm sure they'll be fine.

230
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:27,159
Besides, being a hero doesn't just
mean facing huge disasters by yourself

231
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,538
or fighting evil villains like what you did.

232
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:36,626
Interacting with those they protect will
also be an important experience for them.

233
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,258
I'm exhausted...

234
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,678
We've gone Plus Ultra beyond what's
allowed by the Labor Standards Act.

235
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,140
Class Reps, don't you think
we've taken on too many small jobs?

236
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,435
We shouldn't treat small
and large jobs differently.

237
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,689
Even if we're working as heroes,
we're still students.

238
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,735
We must do them faithfully and
earn the trust of the people of the island.

239
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:07,616
Excuse me! There's someone here who
hasn't done any hero work since we got here.

240
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,410
I've been staying in the office on purpose!

241
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:15,373
What're you gonna do if a villain
comes out while you jerks are out, huh?!

242
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,418
There aren't any villains on this island.

243
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,588
Excuse us.

244
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,173
Mr. Mayor!

245
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,469
Thanks for carrying Granny
to the hospital earlier.

246
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,471
Thanks for fixing my bike.

247
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,806
And our battery!

248
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,766
And for keeping the beach safe!

249
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,726
Here's some fresh fish!

250
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,272
It's not meant to replace our gratitude,
but please eat it if you'd like.

251
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,025
Let's eat!

252
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,694
You people! Show some restraint!

253
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,823
Thank you for going to all this trouble.

254
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,244
Oh no, it's really been
a big help having you all here.

255
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,704
We're counting on you from now on, too.

256
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,127
--Of course!
--We will do our very best to carry out our duty!

257
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,088
Thanks for the food!

258
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,174
That was delicious!

259
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,510
I can feel the kindness of people in my body.

260
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,097
It's moments like these
that make me glad I became a hero.

261
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,765
Yeah.

262
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,143
Kacchan of the Bakugos!

263
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,019
We're gonna take baths and go to sleep.

264
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,814
So we're counting on you for the night watch!

265
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,065
Why?!

266
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,277
Because you didn't do anything all day.

267
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:37,539
1,365... 1,366...

268
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,001
--1,367... 1,368...

269
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,211
--I will tell you the truth.
--1,367... 1,368...

270
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,467
My Quirk is the power to transfer power...

271
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,678
One For All!

272
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,597
One person cultivates the power

273
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:58,476
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it and passes it on.

274
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:04,232
It is the crystallization of power that spins
together the voices of those who need help

275
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,735
and the hearts of the brave.

276
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,906
And next, it is your turn.

277
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,327
Now that you have inherited One For All,

278
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,246
you may one day have
to fight against this great evil...

279
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,211
Next, it's your turn.

280
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:36,473
Right now, I can only use
One For All at 20% at the most.

281
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:43,063
I need to work harder and harder
so I can make this Quirk my own.

282
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,154
Kacchan!

283
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,864
--Oh, thanks for going on patrol.

284
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,952
--Looks like you've grown a bit with your One For All.
--Oh, thanks for going on patrol.

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,038
We can't talk about that here...!

286
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,082
I'm impatient.

287
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,960
I-I know that better than anybody.

288
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,587
I've known you since we were kids.

289
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,634
Then hurry up and make your Quirk your own

290
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,928
and fight me!

291
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,225
I'll prove to you

292
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,728
that I'm the one who will become number one.

293
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:30,944
Yeah, I'll definitely make
my Quirk my own and show you.

294
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,532
In order to become the greatest hero...

295
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,868
And I'll be better than the greatest.

296
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,252
Um...

297
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,422
You're from this afternoon...

298
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,591
A-A villain's...

299
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,843
...come out!

300
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,052
A villain?!

301
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,305
Tell me more!

302
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,474
"Heroes Public Safety Commission"

303
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:06,688
There have been continuous acts of
violence against heroes since last week.

304
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,982
All the victims were knocked unconscious...

305
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,068
...and they all lost their Quirks.

306
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,530
Shigaraki and his group have acquired
a Quirk-erasing needle manufactured illegally

307
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,450
by a designated villain group.

308
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,412
Do we have reports of them
succeeding in their mass production?

309
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,289
No, we do not.

310
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,874
Then investigate.

311
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,334
Continue your secret inves--

312
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,004
Have you thought about the possibility
that their Quirks were stolen?

313
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,589
What?

314
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,758
The victims were heroes,

315
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,720
so the Quirks that were lost
were naturally all useful ones.

316
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:46,019
If the suspect has a Quirk
that can steal Quirks like All For One...

317
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,938
That's...

318
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,108
Well, either way, it's related to Shigaraki.

319
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,736
I'll try investigating both possibilities.

320
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,282
So, where'd the cargo end up?

321
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,285
The heroes didn't collect it, right?

322
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,330
Yeah, that's been confirmed.

323
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,501
What was the cargo, anyway?

324
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,506
According to Doctor,
there's no need for us to know.

325
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,924
What the hell?

326
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,551
He just makes us do the transporting,
but he won't tell us anything?

327
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,179
Doesn't it make you even more curious?

328
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,015
Anyway, forget about it. Got it?

329
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,141
Roger!

330
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,935
No way!

331
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,772
Tomura Shigaraki.

332
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,441
Do not touch that.

333
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,027
Forget about it.

334
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,320
Doctor...

335
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,703
"Kyushu Region"

336
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,626
You said the next time you could
come home was in ten days, right?

337
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,254
Daddy, do your best at work.

338
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,965
You don't have to worry about us!

339
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,510
I'll take good care of Katsuma.

340
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,680
Thanks, Mahoro, Katsuma.

341
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,391
I'll bring back as many souvenirs as--

342
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,862
I've finally found it...

343
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,865
F-Found what...?

344
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,660
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

345
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,705
But I'll take your Quirk.

346
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,665
We finally got it, huh?

347
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:16,586
With this, we can make it a reality...

348
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,047
The new world...

349
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,716
...that we desire.

350
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,596
Nine?!

351
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,099
Wh-Why?

352
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,601
Why...?

353
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,897
It doesn't work on type B blood...

354
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,065
What?

355
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,235
After coming this far,
we're back to square one? Damn it!

356
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,779
No, there's still a way.

357
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,533
Daddy, do your best at work.

358
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,535
--You don't have to worry about us!

359
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,161
--I see...
--You don't have to worry about us!

360
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,413
Quirks...

361
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,707
...are hereditary...

362
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,420
Why are you here, too, damn Deku?!

363
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,923
Why? Because if there really is a villain--

364
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,551
I'll be fine by myself!

365
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,053
Hey, where'd you see the villain?!

366
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,430
I-Inside those castle ruins!

367
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,391
Tell me that first!

368
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,686
Mahoro...!

369
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,692
Over there!

370
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,279
Go hide.

371
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,822
Katsuma!

372
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,285
Stun Grenade!

373
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,415
This guy's...

374
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,543
Kacchan!

375
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,965
Huh?

376
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,515
Ouch!

377
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,976
The villain...

378
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,645
Ow, ow... Jeez!

379
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,023
At least get a little scared!

380
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,692
Th-That girl...

381
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,279
You're the one who made that villain illusion?

382
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:06,404
Gulp
You're the one who made that villain illusion?

383
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,030
"gulp"

384
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,199
Huh? How did you know it was an illusion?

385
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,618
It's obvious!

386
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,078
There's no shadow!

387
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,955
Hey, damn kid,

388
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:20,126
are you having fun taunting heroes?! Well?!

389
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:27,425
I'm completely different
from your everyday heroes.

390
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:32,180
I'm the one who'll be better than
All Might and take the number one spot,

391
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,682
Katsuki Bakugo!

392
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:34,849
"angry" "angry" "angry"
Katsuki Bakugo!

393
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,058
"angry" "angry" "angry"

394
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:39,812
"angry" "angry" "angry"
You picked the wrong person to taunt!

395
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,021
"angry" "angry" "angry"

396
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,106
"angry" "angry" "angry"
D-Don't scold my big sister.

397
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:42,315
"angry" "angry" "angry"

398
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,608
"angry" "angry" "angry"
Huh?!

399
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:43,858
Huh?!

400
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,486
Are you her accomplice? Then--

401
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,279
You're going overboard, Kacchan!

402
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,698
Let go, damn Deku!

403
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,533
We should just be glad
it was kids playing tricks.

404
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,285
--Katsuma!
--That's the kind of attitude that
makes kids these days act impudent!

405
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,704
--That's the kind of attitude that
makes kids these days act impudent!

406
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,039
--Wait, damn it!

407
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,624
--I told you to stop!
--Wait, damn it!

408
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,878
--I told you to stop!
--Don't give me orders!

409
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,594
Wh-What's up with that Bakugo guy anyway?

410
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,722
Become the number one hero?

411
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,351
Isn't he confusing it with the
ranking of heroes who look like villains?

412
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,398
He... came to save us.

413
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,654
Katsuma, do you want to be a hero that badly?

414
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,327
I'm against it. It's dangerous.

415
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:40,998
Besides, I know of someone
even cooler than a hero.

416
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,751
Who?

417
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,712
Daddy.

418
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:51,092
He's always thinking of us and protecting us.

419
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,055
I want you to be as cool as that.

420
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,357
Among the victims, there's
another one who's lost his Quirk.

421
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:10,361
But this time, he isn't a hero...

422
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,116
On top of that, everything that can be
used to identify him has been stolen.

423
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,912
The suspect doesn't want anyone
to know what Quirk he stole...?

424
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,457
Why does he need to hide it?

425
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,672
Hello, this is the U.A. Hero Agency.

426
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,508
Your travel bag has gone missing?

427
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,761
Okay, we'll send someone right away.

428
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,305
At the shopping arcade,
a tourist said she lost her luggage--

429
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,182
I'll go, I'll go!

430
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,267
Aoyama, come with me!

431
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,435
Oui.

432
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,437
Another lost item?

433
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,521
People should at least try to--

434
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,692
The client sounded really cute on the phone.

435
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,862
I can't leave someone in trouble alone!

436
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,532
Shoji is asking for more support on the beach.

437
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,117
Then, I'll go.

438
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,161
I will go on a regular patrol.

439
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:04,499
I'll go out, too, to help
with the fields at the Nijimas.

440
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,629
I'm off!

441
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,468
Katsuma...?

442
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,053
Is something the matter?

443
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,222
U-Um...

444
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,433
S-Sorry about yesterday...

445
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,064
You're so well-mannered!
You came to apologize?

446
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,358
It's okay, I'm not mad.

447
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,530
Will you tell the other hero I'm sorry, too?

448
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,949
Sure, I'll tell him.

449
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,870
But Katsuma, why did you do that yesterday?

450
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,541
My big sister hates heroes.

451
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,669
Yesterday, too, she said that
even if I said there were villains,

452
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,631
the heroes would be scared
and wouldn't come save me,

453
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,133
so that's why I...

454
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,511
You believed in us.

455
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,138
Huh?

456
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,142
You believed that we would go save you, right?

457
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,395
That's why you came to get us.

458
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:12,066
Yeah.

459
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,526
That pin--

460
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,820
It's the Ninja Hero: Edge Shot, right?

461
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:16,988
Yup!

462
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,824
Do you want to be a hero, too, Katsuma?

463
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,663
My Quirk isn't good for being a hero...

464
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:29,792
Besides... Mahoro says it's dangerous...

465
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:34,463
You're part of that famous
U.A.'s hero course, but you're useless.

466
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:42,054
I see, it's not that Mahoro hates heroes,
it's that she's worried about Katsuma.

467
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,266
Izuku, I can't take this anymore.

468
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,143
You keep getting hurt.

469
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,688
My heart can't take it...

470
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,987
Hey, Katsuma.

471
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,657
What kind of hero do you want to be?

472
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,455
I want to be a strong hero
who can beat up evil villains.

473
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:14,962
Really? I want to be a hero
who can save people in trouble.

474
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,467
Save people in trouble...?

475
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,135
Yeah.

476
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:25,264
You want to be a hero who can
defeat the enemy to save people.

477
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:29,560
I want to defeat the enemy,
so I can save people.

478
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,356
The order is different,
but what we're aiming for is the same--

479
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,484
I think we both want to be the greatest hero.

480
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,071
That's why...

481
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,239
...let's both do our best.

482
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,577
Yeah.

483
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,832
Oh, but we should try not
to worry our families too much.

484
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,501
Yeah!

485
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,132
Little Katsuma really loves heroes, doesn't he?

486
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,300
Here, take this.

487
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,929
Thank you very much, Mrs. Suzumura.

488
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,014
Please be kind to him.

489
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:12,395
He lost his mother when he was very young.

490
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,773
His father works away from home all year,

491
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,652
so he and his older sister,
Mahoro, live on their own.

492
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,197
Of course, those of us in
the neighborhood look after them.

493
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:28,744
But it's lonely to not have
parents around at that age.

494
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,084
Mahoro!

495
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,546
Where did you go, Katsuma?

496
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,840
To see Mister Deku.

497
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,051
I went to say sorry for
what happened yesterday.

498
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,095
Why?

499
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,348
I love Daddy.

500
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,228
I want to be someone as cool as Daddy.

501
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,771
But...

502
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,940
But--

503
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,484
Wh-What is it?!

504
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,447
The breakwater...

505
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,073
Why's the ferry coming this way...?

506
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,034
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

507
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,708
What... What's going on?

508
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:21,047
Chimera, Mummy,
I don't want to be interrupted.

509
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,590
You two are in charge of diversions.

510
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,050
How should we do it?

511
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,676
However you want.

512
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,053
Roger.

513
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,095
Slice.

514
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,930
I know.

515
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,317
V-Villains...

516
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,735
Those are definitely villains.

517
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,321
Mahoro, tell the heroes!

518
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,031
But they're still students...

519
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,450
Mister Deku would help us!

520
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,410
I'm sure of it!

521
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,954
I finished working the fields.

522
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,498
Welcome back, Midoriya.

523
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,333
Good work!

524
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,797
What? If it's a lame job--

525
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,799
Villains appeared at the fishing harbor!

526
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,008
That voice...

527
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,094
You're that damn kid
from yesterday, aren't you?

528
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,221
--Don't think you can keep tricking us--

529
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,388
--I'm not lying!
--Don't think you can keep tricking us--

530
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,598
--I'm telling the truth, Bakugo!

531
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,766
--Hello? It's Deku!
--I'm telling the truth, Bakugo!

532
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,810
--Bastard.
--At the fishing harbor, vi--

533
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,356
What did Mahoro say?

534
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,526
"Nabu island"
"Base Transceiver Station"

535
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,904
Communications have been cut off.

536
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,531
Next...

537
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,659
I hope she was worried over nothing...

538
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,994
Anyway, I'll go to the fishing harbor.

539
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,793
Thank you so, so much!

540
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,586
Isn't it great, Maakun?

541
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,505
Yeah, Miitan.

542
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:49,552
What the heck? She had a boyfriend!
Damn that Ashido...

543
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,513
What was that?!

544
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,726
Heroes, it's a v-villain!

545
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,606
It's seriously a villain!

546
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,066
That's too sudden!

547
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:05,901
W-We need to do something!

548
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,362
Aoyama, use your bellybutton beam!

549
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,406
It's called "Navel Laser"!

550
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,623
Oh? Three heroes in the middle of nowhere?

551
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,010
He just made more...!

552
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,057
Hagakure, did you contact the office?

553
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,976
I can't reach them!

554
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:39,226
I don't have any signal!

555
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,394
"No Service"
I don't have any signal!

556
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:40,436
"No Service"

557
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,520
No way!

558
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:45,357
If I keep shooting, my stomach will...

559
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,567
Damn it!

560
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,694
What should we do?!

561
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,489
Froppy, Tentacole!

562
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,283
Evacuating everyone is our first priority!

563
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,659
Got it!

564
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,913
Get away from here, quickly.

565
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,998
Twirling Tail Dance!

566
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,793
What are you after?

567
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,462
Why are you doing this?!

568
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,173
You're young for a hero.

569
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,512
--Tokoyami!
--Sorry I'm late!

570
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,722
Dark Shadow!

571
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,307
Got it!

572
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,564
We can't use our smartphones.

573
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,191
Go back to the office and get help!

574
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,275
But--

575
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,736
I'll hold things here!

576
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,991
Huh? My phone has no signal!

577
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,992
You're right.

578
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,869
--Mine, too.
--And mine.

579
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,329
What's going on?

580
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,081
Don't tell me...

581
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,750
This is bad! Th-There's a villain!

582
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,001
A villain?!

583
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,003
He's going wild at the shopping arcade!

584
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,256
There are heroes fighting him, but--

585
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,298
Reporting in!

586
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,008
A villain has appeared at the beach!

587
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,552
--What?!
--Ojiro and the others are fighting a defensive battle.

588
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,720
They're asking for help!

589
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,682
--Iida!
--There's no time to hesitate.

590
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,684
Everyone here, split up into two groups

591
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,519
and deal with the villains!

592
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,063
Bakugo, Kirishima, and Kaminari,

593
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,649
intercept the villain at the shopping arcade!

594
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,068
Yaoyorozu, Jiro, and Ashido,

595
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:14,029
work on relief and evacuation of
the islanders in the shopping arcade!

596
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,283
Todoroki, Sato, Sero, and Tokoyami,

597
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,243
come with me to the beach!

598
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,703
Uraraka and Koda,

599
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,580
you're on relief and evacuation
of the people at the beach!

600
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,624
We're in a race against time.

601
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,460
We're the only heroes on this island.

602
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,964
And we're the only ones who
can save the people on this island!

603
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:36,468
U.A. High School hero course
Class 1-A, heading out!

604
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,305
The fishing harbor!

605
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,724
I need to tell everyone...

606
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,475
No signal...?

607
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,604
Villains have come to this island.

608
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,942
The others are probably also aware of
the situation and are dealing with them.

609
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:55,446
Then right now,
I should confirm Mahoro's safety.

610
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,073
Mahoro lives...

611
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,618
...those of us in the
neighborhood look after them.

612
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,038
...near Mrs. Suzumura!

613
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,176
M-My stomach is at its limit...

614
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,554
My scalp is at its limit, too...

615
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,640
Mineta! Aoyama!

616
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:30,022
You're struggling too much against small fry,

617
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,482
you extras!

618
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,859
Bakugo!

619
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,486
Hey!

620
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,447
Red Riot is on the scene!

621
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,576
Chargebolt is also on the scene!

622
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,036
You two!

623
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,746
Friends, huh?

624
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,164
Everyone!

625
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,957
Yao-momo, everyone!

626
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,002
We'll evacuate the people of
the island and provide first-aid relief.

627
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,045
Right!

628
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,714
Armor-Piercing Shot: Auto-Cannon!

629
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,429
Oh, no!

630
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,806
Sorry!

631
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,391
Bakugo!

632
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,725
Damn it!

633
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,270
What the hell?!

634
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:14,608
Objects wrapped in my bandages
will move according to my will.

635
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:19,196
It does not work on living things,
but the materials you have on your body...

636
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:23,450
Your armor and clothes are all mine to control.

637
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,329
Bakugo!

638
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,378
Fight amongst yourselves!

639
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:41,927
Ojiro!

640
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,679
Octoblow!

641
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:50,352
With that appearance,
you must've been bullied a lot.

642
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,188
Did you ever resent your parents for it?!

643
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,815
Huh?

644
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,489
--Shoji!
--Leave this place to us!

645
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,575
Take care of Ojiro!

646
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,121
--Now!
--Tokoyami, Sato!

647
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,540
Sugar Rush!

648
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,750
Don't push your luck!

649
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,675
Sato!

650
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,469
Hey, hey,

651
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:27,806
even if you're all kids,
there are too many heroes here.

652
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,436
Mahoro, we need to tell
the heroes about the villains!

653
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,980
My cell phone doesn't work,
so I can't do anything about that.

654
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:38,442
Let's go home first and
let the people in the village--

655
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,951
Our house...

656
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:52,456
Found you.

657
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,543
Cell activation of type B blood...

658
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:00,339
Boy, I'm going to steal your Quirk.

659
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,092
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

660
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,553
D-Don't come any closer!

661
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:12,768
I... I-I said don't come closer!

662
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,438
I know it's just an illusion.

663
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,734
Mahoro...

664
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,491
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

665
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,037
A super power Quirk...

666
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,041
--Are you okay? Can you run?
--Yeah.

667
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,626
Hurry up and get away from here.

668
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,211
Okay!

669
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,717
Stop!

670
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,513
Why are you targeting those kids?!

671
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,597
Move.

672
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,724
No way I'm moving.

673
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,811
If you're going to get
in the way, then I'll kill you.

674
00:39:58,689 --> 00:39:59,773
An invisible wall?!

675
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,358
A wall made of air?

676
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,282
He fired from his nails?

677
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,868
Two Quirks that aren't related at all...

678
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,954
That's almost exactly like...

679
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,791
...All For One...

680
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,962
Stop, Bakugo!

681
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,216
He's being completely controlled...

682
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,176
What should we do, Kirishima?

683
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,720
You're asking me?

684
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,638
Shoot!

685
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,348
Damn it...

686
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:34,808
Choose.

687
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,936
Become my puppets...

688
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,772
...or be defeated by your friend...

689
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,611
Stop screwing around!

690
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,947
What?!

691
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:55,120
Don't underestimate me, mummy bastard!

692
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,915
He sacrificed it on his own...

693
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:16,058
I stocked up a lot, you know.

694
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,895
Maximum blast...

695
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,814
Die...!

696
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,574
Yeah, good job, Bakugo!

697
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:35,952
He kept the damage to
the buildings to a minimum, too.

698
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,996
--Everyone!
--Where's the villain?

699
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,666
What? I beat him easily.

700
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,292
What about the islanders?

701
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,920
We've evacuated them all
to the west district.

702
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,547
Where are you going, Bakugo?!

703
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,258
I'll leave the rescuing to you guys!

704
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,844
I'm gonna go crush the other villains!

705
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,772
Damn it, he's holding us down with power.

706
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,857
Iida, what can we do?

707
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:09,319
Right now, we should only think
about how we can hold this guy here

708
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,446
until the islanders finish evacuating.

709
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,117
Black Abyss!

710
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,620
Reciproburst!

711
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,962
Not putting up much of a fight, heroes!

712
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,550
Wh--?!

713
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,308
At this rate...

714
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,310
Delaware Smash...

715
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,563
...Air Force!

716
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,277
Stone-like blasts of air...

717
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,946
That's an interesting way of using it.

718
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,741
I can't let that guy get close
to Katsuma and Mahoro.

719
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,201
I'll continue to keep him in check like this...

720
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,542
This time it was a gust of wind!

721
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,878
Just how many Quirks does he have?

722
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,298
If the opponent is an unknown, then rather
than take the wait-and-see approach,

723
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,091
I should attack first.

724
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,973
One For All: Full Cowling... 20%!

725
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,936
His power increased...!

726
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:28,982
With the most power I can use right now...

727
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:33,403
St. Louis Smash!

728
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,912
Twenty percent... isn't enough?!

729
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,791
This power... this Quirk...

730
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:49,336
...is worth stealing...

731
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:53,590
S-Steal? He said "steal"...

732
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:57,427
He has the same
Quirk as All For One after all...

733
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,722
One For All will be stolen...!

734
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,105
I can't steal it.

735
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:13,652
No, I don't have enough
free spaces to steal them all...

736
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,783
This kid has the potential
to have more than one Quirk...

737
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:24,079
Move, body! Move, move!

738
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,790
His very existence is a threat.

739
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,544
Then, I will simply eliminate him...

740
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,757
I was pushed back by a wall of air?

741
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:37,551
Mister Deku...?

742
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,929
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

743
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,806
R-Run away...

744
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:43,807
But...

745
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,809
It's fine, just hurry!

746
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,188
He's after... you tw--

747
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,818
Mister Deku!

748
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,366
Hurry...

749
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:03,201
Go...!

750
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:10,625
No... No...

751
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,628
No...!

752
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,675
What is that?

753
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:21,344
Deku...?

754
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,513
Someone, please...

755
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:27,517
Protect Deku...!

756
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,857
An exploding Quirk...

757
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,526
Found you, damn villain!

758
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,695
Kacchan!

759
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:39,905
That's...

760
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,114
Bakugo?!

761
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,658
Kids, look closely!

762
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:47,078
At the strength of the man who'll become...

763
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,289
...the number one hero!

764
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,917
Got you!

765
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,426
Kacchan!

766
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,722
D-Damn it...

767
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:09,309
Kacchan, the villain has multiple Quirks.

768
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,269
He steals them!

769
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,731
Damn, like All For One, huh?

770
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,027
Then I've got even more reason to crush him!

771
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,863
If I've seen it once...

772
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,413
...it's not gonna work on me again!

773
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:42,801
It's got my ribs...!

774
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,347
Move...

775
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,057
Move...!

776
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,643
You just won't stop barking.

777
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,521
The same goes for you!

778
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,817
Damn Deku!

779
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,032
Detroit...

780
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,742
...Sma--

781
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,128
Wh-What's happening...?!

782
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,463
What is that?

783
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,757
The electricity...

784
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,015
Now...

785
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:38,356
I won't... let you go...

786
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:42,902
Th-The fight... isn't over yet...

787
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,654
Mister Deku...!

788
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,406
Bakugo!

789
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:51,995
Heroes really are...

790
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,255
I-Is he in pain?

791
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,090
Why?

792
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,967
Nine!

793
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:07,761
Get a hold of yourself, Nine.

794
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,221
Th-The boy...

795
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,098
I understand.

796
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,560
Don't struggle.

797
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,690
Don't worry, we're friends.

798
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,568
Now, while they're distracted!

799
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,737
--Tsu!
--Ribbit!

800
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,119
Follow them!

801
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:37,165
Get that boy no matter what it takes!

802
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,416
Nine,

803
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,794
they can't leave this island.

804
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,630
You should let your body heal right now.

805
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,052
That's it?

806
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,263
You barely escaped with your lives, huh, kids?

807
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:55,809
He's running away?

808
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,645
It's probably more accurate
to say he's letting us go.

809
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,396
--Damn it.
--Don't go!

810
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,273
It might be a trap.

811
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,485
He's someone we couldn't bring
down even with this many people.

812
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,237
It's dangerous to go after him alone.

813
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,238
But--

814
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,116
We need to check to make sure
the islanders are safe right now.

815
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,451
That's a hero's job, too.

816
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,682
You two are using too much of your Quirks...

817
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,268
We don't know when the villains will be back.

818
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,771
If I don't work too hard here,
then when will I--yay!

819
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,232
You're already in your "yay" mode.

820
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:48,903
--Here you go.
--Thanks.

821
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,613
It's hot, so be careful.

822
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,448
Please take only one per person!

823
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,784
There's enough for everyone.

824
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,582
What happened to the villains?

825
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,208
Please do not worry.

826
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,128
We will definitely protect you all.

827
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,341
It's a good thing this island
has a lot of ingredients.

828
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,427
What happened to the villain we caught?

829
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,514
Oh, he's been locked up in
the boiler room in the basement.

830
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,518
Apparently, he's not saying anything
no matter how much he's interrogated.

831
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:26,232
Todoroki, how are Deku and Bakugo?

832
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,401
They haven't regained consciousness yet.

833
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,405
The doctor from the clinic
is treating them, but...

834
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,702
Thank you for your hard work.

835
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:43,708
Sorry, all our Quirks can do
is to close up their wounds.

836
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,044
We can't do anything about their broken bones.

837
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,005
They'd have to be taken to a hospital
on the main island for more than this.

838
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,843
Let me help.

839
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,386
Katsuma?

840
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:59,098
Katsuma's Quirk looks like
it's the activation of cells.

841
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,893
We don't know if he can heal
their injuries or not, though...

842
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:05,563
They got hurt protecting us.

843
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,357
That's why...

844
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,401
I'd like to ask for
your help, too, Little Katsu.

845
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,195
Okay!

846
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:15,323
I need to save them!

847
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:20,328
No, I will save them!

848
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,044
How's Nine doing?

849
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,212
He's fine.

850
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,465
He should wake up in a few hours.

851
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:33,841
Where's Mummy?

852
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,635
He's not here?

853
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,137
Don't tell me the heroes got him?!

854
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,431
Of course not.

855
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,018
Even if that was the case,
our plan will still continue.

856
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:47,188
It definitely... definitely will.

857
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,704
Why are you saving me?

858
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,164
Come with me.

859
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:12,880
We will destroy the society where
you were called a monster and a villain.

860
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,552
A world where only the powerful rule...

861
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,679
That's what we'll make.

862
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:32,483
Join the League of Villains?

863
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:33,818
Strictly speaking,

864
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:37,447
I will donate my body to the
League's Quirk-enhancing experiment.

865
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,490
Are you planning on using them?

866
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,743
It's too dangerous.

867
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:50,626
We need an even greater power.

868
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:55,590
We bet everything on you.

869
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,800
Don't die on us...

870
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:08,603
You're compatible with
All For One's Quirk factor.

871
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:15,818
You've become a being who can
steal eight Quirks and use nine.

872
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:20,323
The experiment was a success.

873
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,742
With this, our plan is--

874
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,245
But the side effects have also gotten worse.

875
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,081
If I use the Quirks too much,

876
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,958
my body's cellular tissues get destroyed.

877
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:31,959
That's...

878
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:35,296
Then there was no point in getting the surgery!

879
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:39,175
I'll steal a cell activation Quirk.

880
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,637
And then...

881
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,015
...the world we desire...

882
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,443
Katsuma, you should sleep a little...

883
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,445
No, I can keep going.

884
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:02,031
--But...
--I can do it.

885
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,826
I'm not gonna give up.

886
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,539
A hero doesn't give up...!

887
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,089
Mister Deku!

888
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,174
Bakugo!

889
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,428
First, here's a report on the current situation.

890
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,721
The communications and
electricity grids have been destroyed

891
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,849
and we cannot call for help...

892
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:32,979
Earlier, I created a drone that
could transmit an S.0.S. message

893
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,857
and sent it toward the main island.

894
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,151
It will take at least six hours to land there.

895
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,571
And then it will take even
more time for help to arrive.

896
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,116
I don't think the villains
will wait that long...

897
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:50,496
Right now, our highest priority must be
to protect the people of the island...

898
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:55,334
--How?
--The villain was able to beat up Midoriya and Bakugo so much that they passed out!

899
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:58,629
The one we fought was also extremely skilled.

900
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,173
Even if we're going to fight,

901
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,384
Yao-momo and Kaminari have both
used up a lot of their Quirks already...

902
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:04,760
Yay.

903
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,306
Of just the ones we know of,
there are still three villains left.

904
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,184
If they all attack at once,
we won't stand a chance.

905
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,145
At least, if we knew
what the villains were after...

906
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:18,024
Yeah, then we could come up with a plan.

907
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,235
I'm going to steal your Quirk.

908
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,451
Katsuma--

909
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,954
The villains are after me.

910
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:33,164
What did you say?

911
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,042
He said that he would steal my Quirk.

912
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,835
Quirk hijacking?

913
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,338
It's just like All For One, huh?

914
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,632
But we know what the villains are after.

915
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,425
We can just take this boy and run away--

916
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,552
It's not going to be that easy.

917
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,012
We're up against villains here.

918
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:52,517
They could threaten to kill the islanders
if we don't give them the boy.

919
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,102
Then what should we do...?

920
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,526
Give me to the villains!

921
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:04,695
--What?
--He said he wouldn't kill me.

922
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,365
It's fine if I lose my Quirk.

923
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,034
If that will save everyone on the island...

924
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:12,119
We can't do that!

925
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:14,872
Deku?

926
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,625
Midoriya, are you okay now?

927
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,629
Thanks to Katsuma's Quirk.

928
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,007
My Quirk isn't good for being a hero...

929
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,261
Cell activation...

930
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:30,513
Accelerated cell regeneration...

931
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,974
And even enhanced performance...

932
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,643
Thanks to that,
I've already recovered this much!

933
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,646
It's an amazing Quirk, Katsuma.

934
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,565
Thanks.

935
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,526
Mister Deku...

936
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,779
We won't let anything scary happen to you.

937
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:49,824
That's what we're here for!

938
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:56,205
So, we just have to kill
those damn villains, right?

939
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,040
Bakugo!

940
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,755
Save people to win and win to save people.

941
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,342
If you both recognize each other

942
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:11,137
and can focus on making each other stronger...

943
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,474
...then you can become the greatest heroes.

944
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:23,608
We will definitely protect you two.

945
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,901
We'll crush those villains.

946
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,154
We'll also definitely
save the people of the island!

947
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,573
We'll definitely win!

948
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,659
Bakugo, Midoriya, I'm on board, too.

949
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:37,705
I want to protect the people of the island, too.

950
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:38,706
Let's fight!

951
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,708
If you insist.

952
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,211
If I don't fix the tractor at
Mr. Matsuda's, I'll be stuck at yay.

953
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,050
Me, too. I want Granny Sato to live a long life.

954
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,343
Count me in, too!

955
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:51,344
And me.

956
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,137
--Me, too.
--Of course!

957
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:54,889
--Me, too!
--Yeah.

958
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,849
--Me, too!
--Ribbit!

959
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:58,809
All right, let's do this!

960
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:00,394
Yeah, let's do it.

961
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,896
That's all we can do.

962
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,981
Because we're heroes!

963
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,567
We'll overcome the impossible.

964
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:08,861
It's something we always say, right?

965
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,738
Go beyond!

966
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,491
Plus Ultra!

967
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,704
Midoriya, what's the plan?

968
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:21,165
We know there are at least
three villains still out there.

969
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:24,126
We'll use the castle ruins with
a sheer cliff behind us as our base

970
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:27,296
and leave the enemy only
a single route to reach us.

971
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,174
Then, split up the villains
with a preemptive strike.

972
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,176
Using the terrain in each area...

973
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:34,261
...we'll beat them into the ground!

974
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:38,057
We'll have the people of the island
evacuate into a cave in the cliff.

975
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,185
Katsuma and Mahoro will be guarded by us.

976
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,105
We also should secure an escape route
to use if it comes down to it.

977
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:46,899
How will we deal with
the one with multiple Quirks?

978
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,026
When Kacchan and I fought him,

979
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:51,654
he suddenly looked like he was in pain.

980
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,866
It's probably too hard on his body
for him to use the Quirks a lot.

981
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:59,912
That's why he's trying to steal
Katsuma's cell activation Quirk.

982
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,915
I see, so we'll exhaust him.

983
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:07,169
We'll attack the villain in waves
and make him use his Quirks.

984
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:08,629
Since he can steal Quirks,

985
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:11,549
we'll do this in a way
that avoids close combat if possible.

986
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:15,594
If that lets us defeat
the villain, that's great.

987
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,055
But even if we can't,
if we can just last until help comes...

988
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:20,015
...then we can protect everyone.

989
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,559
No.

990
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,270
We'll definitely win.

991
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,400
Nine.

992
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,736
The target is at the top of the castle mountain.

993
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:32,820
The heroes are, too.

994
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,322
What, a siege?

995
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,660
Let's head toward our goal.

996
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,537
One who will become king

997
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,789
doesn't need to rely on cheap tricks.

998
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:55,885
They're here. Three of them.

999
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,471
They're walking together
on the route we predicted.

1000
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:02,683
We're counting on you, Yaoyorozu, Aoyama.

1001
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:06,187
Twenty seconds until
the villains reach the spot...

1002
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,648
Aoyama, Navel Laser at max output!

1003
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,485
Energy charge...!

1004
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:17,740
Five, four, three, two, one!

1005
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,618
Can't Stop Twinkling...

1006
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,704
...Supernova!

1007
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,878
Plus Ultra!

1008
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,301
They've split up!

1009
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:43,432
Using the last of my lipids, I made these!

1010
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,352
My final attack!

1011
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,315
Where are they aimin--

1012
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:53,067
What?!

1013
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,367
Phase one, finished...

1014
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,869
S-Some leaked out...

1015
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,247
We've succeeded in splitting them up!

1016
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:07,289
All right!

1017
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,667
The villains are being
lured to the arranged spots!

1018
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,254
So far, everything's going according to plan.

1019
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:15,506
We will definitely protect everyone!

1020
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,388
Tape Shot...

1021
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,348
...Trident!

1022
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,642
Release!

1023
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,148
Uraraka!

1024
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,485
That was close!

1025
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,154
Sero!

1026
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,580
Make the villain...

1027
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,665
...use his Quirks!

1028
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,835
Shoot away!

1029
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:02,177
They split us up, huh?

1030
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,018
I messed up!

1031
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,187
That was close!

1032
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:18,193
Ashido, leave the rest to me.

1033
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,487
This is my world.

1034
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,532
Cheeky boy.

1035
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,666
Damn... They split us up discreetly, huh?

1036
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,680
--All right!
--All according to plan.

1037
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:48,098
No.

1038
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,857
Hey, that was cold.

1039
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,776
We meet again.

1040
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,569
Stop that.

1041
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,655
Today...

1042
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:06,492
...I'm serious.

1043
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,160
We're different today, too!

1044
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,330
Now that all the islanders
are evacuated, we can go all out...

1045
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,290
...to stop you.

1046
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,126
Recipro Turbo!

1047
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:18,879
Let's end this in ten minutes!

1048
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:20,839
--Yeah! --Right!
--Ribbit!

1049
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,136
Just what I wanted.

1050
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,392
Damn it, we couldn't even slow him down!

1051
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:34,436
What about this?

1052
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,088
It's almost time for our real attack!

1053
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,465
--Y-Yeah!
--Sero! Uraraka!

1054
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:04,550
Mineta!

1055
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,802
I'm ready!

1056
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,763
We're counting on you, Uraraka!

1057
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:19,732
Plus...

1058
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,277
...Ultra!

1059
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:38,000
Go, Mineta!

1060
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:42,504
Super Grape Rush!

1061
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:45,966
Take that, and that,
and that, and that, and that!

1062
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:50,054
And that, and that,
and that, and that, and that!

1063
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:54,141
This was our real attack!

1064
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,478
--All right!
--W-We did it...

1065
01:04:58,771 --> 01:04:59,938
Are you all right?!

1066
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,648
Serves you right...

1067
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:03,817
We've sealed you away...

1068
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,244
He defended against the real attack!

1069
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:16,914
The villain's approaching
Uraraka and the others!

1070
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,343
In that case...

1071
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:33,639
Aoyama!

1072
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,849
Yao-momo!

1073
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,476
While you have the chance...

1074
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,228
Prepare yourselves--

1075
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,314
It's no use.

1076
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,319
Playtime's over.

1077
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,457
You were still alive?

1078
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:05,254
If you're gonna sleep-talk, then sleep and die!

1079
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,132
Bakugo's joined the battle!

1080
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,343
--Midoriya?
--Take care of Katsuma and Mahoro!

1081
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:13,762
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

1082
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,099
We'll defend this place till the end!

1083
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,601
Take this!

1084
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,689
If I can't protect them here,

1085
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,525
then there's no point in trying to be a hero!

1086
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:31,613
St. Louis Smash!

1087
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,160
It doesn't have to be at full power.

1088
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:39,288
Just think about how
to make him use his Quirks!

1089
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:48,922
X-Catapult!

1090
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:00,309
Not bad...

1091
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,352
After this...

1092
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,646
...we'll kill you!

1093
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,155
What do you mean, "This is my world"?

1094
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,365
Say something more energetic!

1095
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:18,118
Is that all you've got?

1096
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,206
She's made more moves.

1097
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,084
I just need an opening for an instant!

1098
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:28,003
How pathetic.

1099
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,343
Black Abyss: Sabbath!

1100
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:39,139
--Now!
--Acid Shot!

1101
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,559
We'll decide this all at once!

1102
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:46,271
How dare you...

1103
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,698
Ashido!

1104
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:05,123
You little...!

1105
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,670
Th... This is...

1106
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:16,927
I won't let you get in Nine's way!

1107
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,455
Tokoyami?

1108
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,249
Dark Shadow...

1109
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,044
Pay attention to what's in front of you!

1110
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:52,671
I know!

1111
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,051
It's no use!

1112
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:01,096
Red Gauntlet!

1113
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:02,723
That itches.

1114
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:23,702
I told you brats that it was no use!

1115
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,372
M-My body's...?!

1116
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:30,792
There was a reason why we
repeated the same boring moves.

1117
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:34,463
On my legs and Kirishima's hands,

1118
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:38,216
we smeared a toxic mucus made by Asui.

1119
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,218
You mean, "Tsu."

1120
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,305
Resign yourself, old man!

1121
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,099
Acting so insolent...

1122
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:50,437
I'll show you...

1123
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,274
...why I'm called a monster!

1124
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,280
He's gotten bigger?!

1125
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:03,075
That form makes him look like Amajiki!

1126
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,169
--Damn!
--Asui!

1127
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,504
Ribbit!

1128
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,105
That's where lida and the others are...

1129
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,399
Are they having a hard time?
We should go--

1130
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:36,733
You can't!

1131
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:40,695
Our job is to protect Katsuma and Mahoro.

1132
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:43,240
Mister Deku...

1133
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,075
Bakugo...

1134
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,838
I won't let you!

1135
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,218
Sero!

1136
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,223
I'll touch him and make him float!

1137
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,479
Uraraka!

1138
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,691
Not... yet...

1139
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,693
Bastard...

1140
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,322
How could you?!

1141
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,796
We're getting pushed back.

1142
01:11:40,005 --> 01:11:42,757
At this rate, Katsuma and Mahoro...

1143
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:45,969
Damn it...

1144
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,027
Th-This is...

1145
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:10,494
There it is! His time limit!

1146
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,879
That's some crazy power!

1147
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,965
We can't even get close to him.

1148
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,469
My Recipro will be done soon.

1149
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,888
Make an opening for me.

1150
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,681
Get me close to him.

1151
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,642
And then?

1152
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,644
I have an idea.

1153
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,021
All right.

1154
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,273
This will be our last attack!

1155
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:56,081
Iida, distract him with your Recipro Turbo!

1156
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:13,890
Doesn't this remind you of Camino?

1157
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:15,100
Yeah.

1158
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:19,062
Whatever attack comes,
I'll take it and get you close to him for sure!

1159
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:20,522
Yeah!

1160
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,738
Unbreakable!

1161
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,711
Kirishima!

1162
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:49,301
Go...

1163
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,850
Increase the temperature in
your body to its maximum limit.

1164
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,229
What I could do with my flames...

1165
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,231
...I'll do with my ice now!

1166
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,533
Todoroki!

1167
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:20,832
Go down, as low as possible!

1168
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,171
Ribbit!

1169
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:33,261
Freeze!

1170
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:55,325
Hibernate for a while...

1171
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:03,375
W-We've... done... our duty...

1172
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:08,213
Midoriya... Bakugo...

1173
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,556
Kacchan, let's attack in waves!

1174
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,308
Don't give me orders!

1175
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:25,188
I-If only I could get
the cell activation Quirk...

1176
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,566
Let's get a sure hit in here!

1177
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:33,488
...then I wouldn't have to conserve anything!

1178
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,142
Mister Deku...

1179
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,018
Bakugo...

1180
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:09,816
--Mister Deku!
--Bakugo!

1181
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,781
Activation of cells?

1182
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:17,866
Yes.

1183
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:22,454
But I can only activate
the cells of type A blood.

1184
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,623
It's not a Quirk that can really help anyone...

1185
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,042
Mr. Shimano, do you have any family?

1186
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:32,255
I'm from Nabu Island,
and my daughter and son still live there...

1187
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,257
That's pretty far,

1188
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:34,924
but Nabu Island is within
the culprit's range of progression.

1189
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,801
"Nabu Island"
but Nabu Island is within
the culprit's range of progression.

1190
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,260
"Nabu Island"

1191
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,180
Excuse me.

1192
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,432
What is it?

1193
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,895
A fishing boat sailing near
Kyushu received an S.0.S. message.

1194
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,148
Villains have attacked Nabu Island,
and they request help immediately.

1195
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,359
That's the suspect in the Quirk-loss crimes!

1196
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:56,446
--What did you say?
--Send a rescue team to Nabu Island immediately!

1197
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,073
Oh, and contact U.A. High School.

1198
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,409
U.A.? Why?

1199
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:06,456
For the practical hero work recommendation
project sponsored by the commission,

1200
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:12,045
the ones stationed at Nabu Island are
U.A. High School's hero course Class 1-A.

1201
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,966
Shoji, take Katsuma and Mahoro
and get out of here.

1202
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:18,593
Please.

1203
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:22,096
All right!

1204
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,766
We'll definitely hold him back.

1205
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,392
Yeah.

1206
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,439
Found you...

1207
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,448
Heartbeat Distortion!

1208
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,910
Twirling Tail Dance!

1209
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,665
Ojiro!

1210
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,844
I need to get to the escape route...

1211
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,313
G-Get away...!

1212
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:13,857
Run!

1213
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,823
Both of you, run!

1214
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,616
Hurry!

1215
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,368
Go!

1216
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,554
Katsuma, run away!

1217
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:45,763
M-Mahoro?

1218
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:47,640
It's fine, just run away!

1219
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,225
Don't come any closer!

1220
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:51,853
Don't lay a hand on my little brother!

1221
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,481
I said, don't come any closer!

1222
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,943
Mahoro!

1223
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:06,743
I-If you don't want her to die,

1224
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,786
then come here.

1225
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:12,123
No, run away...

1226
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,126
Run away!

1227
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,546
Help me...

1228
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:22,258
...turn my desire into reality...

1229
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:25,219
Run... away...

1230
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:27,972
Katsuma...

1231
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,188
No!

1232
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,522
I will protect you!

1233
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:40,318
I will protect you, Mahoro!

1234
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:50,286
Smash!

1235
01:19:57,919 --> 01:19:59,337
Sorry I'm late!

1236
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,130
Mister Deku...

1237
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:03,925
You did a good job, Katsuma.

1238
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,969
You were amazing!

1239
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:12,058
Bakugo... You're alive...

1240
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,060
I told you, didn't I?

1241
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,437
I'm the man who'll be even better than All Might

1242
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:20,024
and become the number one hero.

1243
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:25,863
Run away with Mahoro!

1244
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,365
Okay!

1245
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,492
Mahoro!

1246
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:40,044
How did you avoid my lightning...?!

1247
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:43,131
You used that on us already!

1248
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,967
That's why

1249
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,971
we used a useless idiot as a lightning rod.

1250
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,182
I-Isn't that a bit much?

1251
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,277
Smash!

1252
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,988
Die!

1253
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,328
Over here!

1254
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,213
Th...

1255
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:27,341
This can't end!

1256
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,095
It can't be the end!

1257
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:42,774
Like I'd let it end like this!

1258
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,376
A tornado!

1259
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,797
Damn, he really can change the weather...

1260
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:11,260
What should we do?

1261
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:13,137
Katsuma and Mahoro are still here...

1262
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:17,016
On top of that, everyone who's
evacuated could be in danger, too!

1263
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,605
Is he planning on destroying this whole island?

1264
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,985
We definitely have to stop him!

1265
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,741
One For All...

1266
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:37,537
...100%!

1267
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:42,583
I'll blow that away with everything I've got!

1268
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:45,253
Detroit...

1269
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,047
...Smash!

1270
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:50,675
Howitzer...

1271
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,678
...Impact!

1272
01:22:58,099 --> 01:22:59,725
Mister Deku!

1273
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,628
Mahoro!

1274
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:38,181
The entrance!

1275
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:43,978
--Sato!
--I can hold this. Get everyone further inside!

1276
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:57,533
E-Even at 100%... it wasn't enough...

1277
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:59,994
D-Damn it...

1278
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:04,540
Even though I lowered myself to fight with Deku...

1279
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:06,167
It's no use.

1280
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:09,503
You will not be able to live
with that level of power.

1281
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:13,007
Not in the new world I will create.

1282
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:15,218
New world...?

1283
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,512
Those who have power--

1284
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,893
The strong will rule
over the weak in my utopia.

1285
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,103
That crap...

1286
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:30,733
It won't matter if someone
is a villain or a hero.

1287
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:34,487
Everything is equal before power...

1288
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,280
That...

1289
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:40,826
...is what a true superhuman society should be.

1290
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:46,916
With such a selfish assumption...

1291
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:49,877
You're crazy...!

1292
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,967
Are you getting in the way of the new world?

1293
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:58,803
Then you should just disappear.

1294
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,097
Think...

1295
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,516
What would All Might do...?!

1296
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:08,854
L-Like I'd let it end here!

1297
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:12,608
Think... Think...

1298
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:15,778
I don't want to lose!

1299
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:17,863
Think...

1300
01:25:19,282 --> 01:25:20,866
Mister Deku!

1301
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:22,868
Bakugo!

1302
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:25,371
Mister Deku!

1303
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:29,333
Don't lose!

1304
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:32,753
So that's where you were.

1305
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,508
Kacchan...

1306
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,887
There's just one way...

1307
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:45,391
There's just one way we can do this...!

1308
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,403
My Quirk was passed
on to me like a sacred torch.

1309
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,364
The power to transfer power...

1310
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:10,207
K-Kacchan...

1311
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:16,130
A hero has a lot to protect.

1312
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:20,009
That's why I won't lose!

1313
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,346
Deku...

1314
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,348
A hero...

1315
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:30,186
...can always break out of a tough spot!

1316
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,941
A way we can protect...

1317
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:40,029
A way we can win...

1318
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,993
There's just one way...

1319
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,554
What...?

1320
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:12,603
If you do this,
will you still be able to use it?

1321
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:14,647
I don't know...

1322
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:16,524
But...

1323
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:22,905
All Might still protected us with
the embers after he transferred it to me.

1324
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,158
What did you do?!

1325
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:30,913
With two... One For Alls...

1326
01:27:32,832 --> 01:27:34,792
...we'll save everyone!

1327
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:38,838
...we'll win!

1328
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:50,850
You two should already be dead...!

1329
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,323
This is the end for your dream then, too, huh?

1330
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:10,870
It's fine. This is the only way.

1331
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,956
Besides, I'm sure All Might

1332
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:17,084
would say that it's fine if it's you.

1333
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:21,881
If it's you, who shared our secret...

1334
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,592
...who admired the same person as me...

1335
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,385
If it's you...

1336
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:31,765
All Might really is cool, isn't he?

1337
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:36,187
He's such a cool hero...

1338
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:42,818
No matter what crisis is
in front of him, in the end...

1339
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,405
...he always wins!

1340
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:50,242
No matter what trouble they're in, he always...

1341
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:53,954
...saves everyone with a smile!

1342
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:59,126
Don't make me laugh!

1343
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,588
Detroit...

1344
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:08,093
...Smash!

1345
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,459
Wh-What is this...?

1346
01:29:40,668 --> 01:29:43,629
What is that power...?

1347
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,345
Don't block...

1348
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:53,055
...my path!

1349
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:55,724
Kacchan, let's go!

1350
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:56,934
Huh?

1351
01:29:57,142 --> 01:30:00,354
Don't give me orders!

1352
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:03,065
Don't get in my way!

1353
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,335
This is...

1354
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,796
...the last...

1355
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,007
...that I'll produce...

1356
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:54,593
The last...

1357
01:31:54,802 --> 01:32:00,683
...Smash!

1358
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,621
Goodbye...

1359
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:26,208
...One For All...

1360
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,293
Thank you...

1361
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:38,804
Are you alive, Tokoyami?

1362
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:44,393
Hawks... Why...?

1363
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:48,188
We came first to save you guys...

1364
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:50,482
Me, and one other guy.

1365
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:58,282
A-All Might...

1366
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:02,411
Young Midoriya, sorry I'm late...

1367
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,664
Wh-What about Kacchan...?

1368
01:33:06,457 --> 01:33:10,836
You always worry about other people first...

1369
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:12,755
He's beat up, but he's fine.

1370
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:14,548
He'll live.

1371
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,800
I'm glad...

1372
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:21,346
I made him do something crazy...

1373
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:23,599
Young Bakugo?

1374
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:29,480
All Might...

1375
01:33:29,688 --> 01:33:33,150
I-1 transferred it...

1376
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:37,279
One For All... to Kacchan...

1377
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:39,698
One For All?!

1378
01:33:39,907 --> 01:33:43,368
If we didn't use two One For Alls,

1379
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:48,207
then we couldn't save
the people of the island...

1380
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:51,627
We couldn't have defeated the villain...

1381
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:55,839
That's why... I don't regret it...

1382
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:58,425
But, I'm sorry...

1383
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:02,304
Even though you chose me
as your successor...

1384
01:34:02,513 --> 01:34:05,849
Even though you said I could become a hero...

1385
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:12,147
But I wanted to protect
everyone no matter what...!

1386
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:15,984
Young Midoriya...

1387
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:20,072
I'm sorry, All Might...

1388
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,949
I'm sorry...

1389
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,619
But I...

1390
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:40,050
Young Midoriya, I don't regret
giving you One For All one bit...

1391
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:43,887
You used it correctly...

1392
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:46,932
The hearts of the brave
that have been spun together...

1393
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,143
The power that is the crystallization of that...

1394
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:06,869
One For All...

1395
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:14,459
Before the transfer finished,
because Young Bakugo lost consciousness...

1396
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,463
No, that's not it.

1397
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:21,383
For the one who risked his life to protect

1398
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:24,970
and the one who risked his life to win...

1399
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:28,682
...One For All gave them a miracle...

1400
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:37,983
Master... All the predecessors...

1401
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:44,531
Thank you very much...

1402
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,709
What are you planning...

1403
01:36:37,918 --> 01:36:39,544
...Tomura Shigaraki?

1404
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:48,804
You were alive, as I thought.

1405
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:51,139
Shigaraki...

1406
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:54,059
Did you have a good life?

1407
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:57,437
It's only begun... It's only...

1408
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:01,900
Don't worry. I'll take over your dream.

1409
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:06,738
There only needs to be one ruler...

1410
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:11,785
That's right... only one...

1411
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,414
Good night, Nine...

1412
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,418
Good work.

1413
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:27,050
Ow...!

1414
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:29,136
What the hell happened?!

1415
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,722
Kiss...!

1416
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:33,598
"Undergoing Treatment"

1417
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:37,728
"Undergoing Treatment"
Kacchan doesn't remember anything
about the transfer of One For All,

1418
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:38,645
Kacchan doesn't remember anything
about the transfer of One For All,

1419
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:42,733
and even now, One For All lives inside me.

1420
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:42,858
"Nabu Port Terminal"
and even now, One For All lives inside me.

1421
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:44,693
"Nabu Port Terminal"

1422
01:37:44,818 --> 01:37:46,445
Daddy!

1423
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:49,114
Mahoro! Katsuma!

1424
01:37:50,449 --> 01:37:56,038
Later, Katsuma and Mahoro were
able to reunite with their father.

1425
01:37:57,748 --> 01:38:01,668
For this incident, we were able
to protect everyone on the island,

1426
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,838
but there was a lot of damage.

1427
01:38:05,047 --> 01:38:09,885
The Heroes Public Safety Commission
immediately suspended the program,

1428
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:12,596
but we stayed on the island
until we were scheduled to leave

1429
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:15,682
to help with recovery efforts.

1430
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:21,313
And then, the last day
of the program arrived...

1431
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:24,524
Shouldn't we say something before we leave?

1432
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:25,776
Right?

1433
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:28,528
We shouldn't get in the way of their rebuilding.

1434
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,906
Well, I guess leaving without a word...

1435
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:32,491
...is also pretty hero-like.

1436
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:33,992
Yes.

1437
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:38,205
It's time to say goodbye to this island, huh?

1438
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,499
Good riddance.

1439
01:38:53,637 --> 01:38:57,057
You don't need to say bye to those kids?

1440
01:38:57,265 --> 01:39:00,018
There are things I wanted to tell them,

1441
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:01,478
but it's fine...

1442
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:04,564
I'm sure they already know what they are.

1443
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,233
Hey!

1444
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,276
Hey!

1445
01:39:08,485 --> 01:39:10,153
Mister Deku!

1446
01:39:10,362 --> 01:39:11,988
Bakugo!

1447
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:14,324
Everyone!

1448
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:17,327
Thanks for protecting everyone...

1449
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:20,247
...on the island!

1450
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:25,627
Mister Deku, I'll get stronger!

1451
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:30,507
Strong enough to protect Daddy and Mahoro!

1452
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:39,975
And then, I'll become
a cool hero like you and Bakugo!

1453
01:39:41,268 --> 01:39:45,522
Don't forget that, damn kid.

1454
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:47,816
Katsuma!

1455
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,401
You...

1456
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:52,946
You can become a hero!

1457
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:58,285
I'll be waiting for you at U.A.!

1458
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:37,657
Come, the time for beginnings is at hand

1459
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:43,079
It's goodbye to those tear-filled nights

1460
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:51,755
One banner for the world
that's raised My Gloria anew

1461
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:58,136
Start walking and,
in time, a wind will surely arise

1462
01:40:58,345 --> 01:41:03,808
Banner aflutter, let's advance

1463
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:06,853
Come, it's nice to meet you

1464
01:41:07,062 --> 01:41:09,940
This story that's awakened

1465
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:13,360
No more hesitation

1466
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,445
Start walking

1467
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:18,865
This story of a dawning

1468
01:41:19,074 --> 01:41:23,954
Even farther beyond

1469
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:33,880
Walking blind and dazzled

1470
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:39,302
The countless banners at
the end of a headlong plunge

1471
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:42,430
Not a single one like another

1472
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:47,727
Yet each a banner raised with pride

1473
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:51,481
Neither ingratiating nor playful

1474
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:59,948
We're simply travelers going to the same place

1475
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,993
Hey, start building

1476
01:42:03,201 --> 01:42:06,162
This glory we fell in love with

1477
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:09,499
Let us go together

1478
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:14,963
Walking side by side, in accord, to this parade

1479
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:18,800
Even farther beyond

1480
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,068
Though morning may birth shadows

1481
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:39,195
And hope may grow ill

1482
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:42,991
Just keep your faith in the here and now

1483
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:47,078
In the resolve that shines in each of us

1484
01:42:47,287 --> 01:42:52,500
March for our cause

1485
01:42:54,336 --> 01:42:57,088
Hey, start building

1486
01:42:57,297 --> 01:43:00,342
This story of freedom

1487
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,511
No more hesitation

1488
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:08,933
Be wrong with one another
to this parade of the dawning

1489
01:43:09,142 --> 01:43:12,187
Let us go together

1490
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:17,484
'Til the day the world ends

1491
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:20,779
Let us keep raising the banner

1492
01:43:20,987 --> 01:43:26,201
Light up one another, transcending even destiny

1493
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:31,081
Even farther beyond

1494
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:39,839
Us to the beyond

1495
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:48,681
All the way beyond
