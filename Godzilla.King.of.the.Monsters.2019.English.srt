why Monarch shouldn't fall under

154
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,732
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

155
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,690
Monarch was tasked
with finding and destroying

156
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,035

But you either can't or won't tell us

how many there are
or why they're showing up.

to put them down.

you're protecting them, Dr. Serizawa.

00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,191
As if you admire them.

167
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,320
I admire all forms of life.

168
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,489
Senators, if we hope to survive,

169
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,323
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

170
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,529
With <i>Gojira.</i>

171
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,832
A sort of symbiotic relationship,
if you will.

172
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,584
Like the lion and the mouse.

173
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,920
Or the scorpion and the frog.

174
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,749
So you'd want to make Godzilla our pet?

175
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,458
No.

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,009
We will be his.

177
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,548
[senators laugh]

178
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,635
[cell phone vibrating]

179
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,471
Uh... No. No, actually.
[chuckles nervously]

180
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,003
That's not what Dr. Serizawa meant.

181
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,303
- We have to go.
- No one is implying that we would be...

182
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,252
- Sam, we have to go.
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.

183
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,314
[Williams] Dr. Serizawa, Dr. Graham,
this hearing is not adjourned.

184
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,729
Dr. Serizawa, I hope you understand

185
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,823
the consequences
of walking out that door.

186
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,822
Uh, you know what, Senators,
while I confer with my colleagues here,

187
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,076
I'm gonna set you up with a very brief
and pretty fun documentary

188
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,451
on Titan reproduction.

189
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,862
I think this is the one
where the genitals are blurred out.

190
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,208
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

191
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,921
[birds chirping]

[wolves continue growling]

195
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,154
[helicopter blades whirring]

196
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,549
[Dr. Graham]
The feed cuts out there.

197
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,853
The survivors haven't been able

198
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,359
to give us much more
than what the footage allows.

199
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,571
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

200
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,820
I'm sorry, Mark.

201
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,030
I should've been there for her.

202
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,330
- Who are they?
- We don't know yet.

203
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,131
We believe they were after this.

204
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:47,884
You didn't.

205
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,469
[Sam] It's the ORCA.

206
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,304
That's why we think they need Emma.

207
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,508
She believed
that if we could somehow replicate

208
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,558
the biosonar the Titans use
to communicate...

209
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,887
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

210
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,264
Who is he?

211
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,520
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

212
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,068
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

213
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,067
I'm a big fan of your wife's work.
And you.

214
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,023
That just came out so weird, I'm sorry.

215
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,529
Emma and I destroyed the prototype.

216
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,986
And then Emma decided to rebuild it.

217
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,741
After San Francisco, she went home
to Boston, spent years developing it.

218
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,083
She thought it could help...

219
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,251
Would help what? Play God?

220
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,981
[Dr. Graham] No.
Help prevent another attack.

221
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,917
ORCA was a grad school science project.

222
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,374
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

223
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,750
Not so you could talk
to your little creatures out there.

224
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,634
Listen to me,
they'll think it's one of them.

225
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,594
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em,

226
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,890
and you're gonna be responsible
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

227
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,972
Which is why we need to get it back.

228
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,351
Emma always said
no one knew the ORCA better than you.

229
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,436
It shouldn't even exist.

230
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,232
That may be, Mark.
But it's fallen into the wrong hands.

231
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,362
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

232
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,952
keeping Emma and Madison alive.

233
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,326
Mark, we know you're hurting.

234
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,533
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

235
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,129
I promise.

236
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,427
[Dr. Graham] <i>When was the last time
you spoke to Emma?</i>

237
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,934
About three years ago.

238
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,554
After San Francisco

239
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,351
we went back home to Boston.

240
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,019
Tried to put the pieces back together.

241
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,404
Emma dealt with it by doubling down
on saving the world

242
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,074
and I started drinking.

243
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,782
I can't tell you how much I hated myself
for letting Maddie see me that way.

244
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,868
Uh, you mind if we cut in here?

245
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,921
It's just, you're gonna wanna see this.

246
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,462
Emma combined the bioacoustics

247
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,761
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

248
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,515
A sort of baseline frequency
that all the creatures respond to.

249
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,187
Attracting them, repelling them,
even at times calming them down.

250
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,138
It's pretty remarkable actually.

251
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,146
[Dr. Graham] The problem is
we don't know which Titans she combined.

252
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,320
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

253
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,490
we'll be able to track the ORCA
and find Emma and Madison.

254
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,576
[Mark] Jesus!

255
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,444
How many of these things are there?

256
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,618
Seventeen and counting after <i>Gojira.</i>

257
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,866
Seventeen?

258
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,921
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

259
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,622
While others, we've contained
at top secret sites around the globe.

260
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,881
Cambodia, Mexico, Skull Island.
We even found one in Wyoming.

261
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,219
They're everywhere.

262
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,508
Why don't you kill 'em?

263
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,427
The government wants to.

264
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,681
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

265
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,560
Don't kid yourself.

266
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,686
Uh... Hey, look at that. We're here.

267
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,488
[indistinct radio chatter]

268
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,496
<i>Castle Bravo, this is Raptor One.
On direct approach.</i>

269
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:17,086
[operator] <i>Raptor One, you are cleared
for assisted descent to pad four.</i>

[Griffin] <i>Sensors set for three meters.

271
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,644
This is new.

272
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,694
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.
Our new flagship facility,

273
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,777
built to track and study Godzilla
on his own turf.

274
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,578
I thought he was missing.

275
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,914
Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

276
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,841
As you know, at approximately 0700 hours

277
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,514
our containment site in China's
Yunnan Rainforest was raided.

278
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,056
The specimen, code name Mothra, escaped.

279
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,522
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

280
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:15,228
While Dr. Emma Russell and
her daughter Madison were taken hostage.

281
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,315
This is the man responsible, Alan Jonah.

282
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,321
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

283
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,196
Obsessed with restoring natural order.

284
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,655
And to fund his operations,

285
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,034
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

286
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,002
Titan DNA.

287
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,940
What the hell is someone gonna do
with a giant worm?

288
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,109
[Rick] Are you kidding, Martinez?
What can't you do with it?

289
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,171
Pharmaceuticals, bioweapons, food...

290
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,299
Hell, there isn't a country or a company
on the planet

291
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,723
that doesn't wanna get its hands
on one of these suckers.

292
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,222
And remember, this is just a larva.

293
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,552
That's a baby.

294
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,060
After it cocoons,
something else is gonna crawl out.

295
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,732
Something bigger, meaner...

296
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,463
- We don't know that, Rick.
- [Rick] Oh, yeah?

297
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,399
Just wait for it, Chen.

298
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,241
Our intel indicates that Jonah
wants to capture this specimen.

299
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,237
Alive.

300
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,035
Which means that he and his mercs
won't be far behind.

301
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,365
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

302
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,786
I wouldn't bother.

303
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,749
Excuse me?

304
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,105
[Mark] Sounds like a duck hunt to me.

305
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,212
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

306
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,833
A decoy. A diversion.

307
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,882
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

308
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,197
Why would they want just this one
when they've got the keys

309
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,885
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

310
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,308
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra,

311
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,386
so they can go after a real prize.

312
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,557
Something bigger.

313
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,684
Right.

314
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,564
Mark, this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

315
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,006
- They know what they are doing.
- [Mark] That's not just a specimen.

316
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,364
I've got an ex-wife and a daughter
out there, in case you forgot.

317
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,035
No. No one has forgotten that, Mark,
but, uh, to remind you,

318
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:50,080
you were brought on here to help track
the ORCA, and to advise us...

319
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,534
I advise you to kill these things.
All of 'em.

320
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,627
Especially him.

321
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,524
You wanna make sure these things
don't fall into the wrong hands?

322
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,631
You kill them and the ORCA's useless.

323
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:03,301
Emma wouldn't have wanted that.
Even to save her life.

324
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,472
Well, it wouldn't be the first time
Emma put all of this before herself

325
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,220
or her family, would it?

326
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,605
Dude hates Titans.

327
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,399
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

328
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,282
[pilot 1] <i>Outpost 32,
this is Raptor Five,</i>

329
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,155
<i>on approach
with reinforcements and supplies.</i>

330
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,653
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

331
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,746
<i>Serizawa has all sites on high alert,
so transmitting emergency codes now.</i>

332
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,246
[operator] <i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

333
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,037
<i>Codes are good. Nice to have you back.</i>

334
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,263
Go.

335
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:54,935
It's good to see ya.

336
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,021
- Need a hand with offload?
- No, we're good!

337
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,714
[man] We're gonna put it over
at bay five.

338
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,321
- Follow me!
- [woman] Go back up! Hey, hey!

339
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,194
- Leave them, let's go!
- [gunfire]

340
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,742
[woman screaming]

341
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,903
[gun firing continues]

342
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,541
I'm scared.

343
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,163
I know. Me, too.

344
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,883
[Jonah] Okay.

345
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,759
[breathes deeply] Let's go.

346
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,219
[wind howling]

347
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,016
Eyes straight ahead.

348
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,857
Deep breaths.

349
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,396
Just like we talked about.

350
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,716
Hmm.

351
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,359
Mother of God.

352
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,529
She had nothing to do with this.

353
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,906
Monster Zero.

354
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,605
[Jonah] Any survivors?

355
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,975
[Asher] No. They tried to launch
an emergency beacon,

356
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,651
but we cut them off in time.

357
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,145
They'll figure it out.

358
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,524
Fire up the drills.

359
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,863
[whistles]

360
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,008
[Jonah] Do you have everything you need?

361
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,360
Good.

362
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,196
Well, let's get started.

363
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,118
[man] Further.

364
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:47,101
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

365
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,856
[Mark] <i>Come on, Andrew. Andrew.</i>

366
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,549
- [Andrew] <i>I've come to eat your horses.</i>
- [Mark] <i>No, you can't eat my horses...</i>

367
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,689
<i>That's not...</i>

368
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,409
<i>Stop.</i>

369
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,451
<i>Look.</i>

370
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,826
<i>- An intruder! Get her!
- Get her!</i>

371
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,713
<i>- Get her! Get her!</i>
- [Emma] <i>No, don't get me!</i>

372
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,241
[Mark] <i>Andrew, Madison! Get her!</i>

373
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,166
- [Andrew] <i>Get her!</i>
- [Mark] <i>Bear kisses.</i>

374
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,789
- [grunting]
- [Emma laughing]

375
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,379
- [Mark] <i>Bear kisses!</i>
- [rumbling]

376
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,225
[Foster] <i>All personnel,
report to battle stations. Code red.</i>

377
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,603
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

378
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,430
<i>- Code red.</i>
- At least 60 knots.

379
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,484
<i>This is not a drill. All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

380
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,607
<i>- Code red.</i>
- [alarm blaring]

381
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,656
What's happening?

382
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,903
Something's wrong.

383
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,905
He's never been this close before.

384
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,782
- Who's he?
- Who do you think?

385
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,909
[rumbling]

386
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,831
He's taking out our observation drones.

387
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,283
Trajectory?

388
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,120
Straight at us!
1,200 meters and closing.

389
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,461
G-Team. Barnes, Martinez, Hendricks,
I want you on those CROWS now!

390
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,588
You heard boss lady! Let's move!

391
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,721
[whirring]

392
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,014
Dr. Stanton.
Do you have his bioacoustics?

393
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,310
Acoustics coming up!

394
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,774
[beeping]

395
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,939
Okay, he's closing. We're at 800 meters!

396
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,049
[Dr. Graham] His movements are erratic.

397
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,439
Heart and breathing elevated.

398
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,694
[Sam] Yeah, he's definitely not happy
about something.

399
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,700
How are they getting all this?

400
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,780
Emma isolated Godzilla's bioacoustics.

401
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,914
It allows us to track him.

402
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,408
Even to get his vitals.

403
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,784
[rumbling]

404
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,748
Circling now, closing in, 200 meters.

405
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,666
Colonel!

406
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,715
All teams in position, weapons hot,
ready to engage on my command.

407
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,847
- [weapons power up]
- Come on, come on, come on.

408
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,053
[Serizawa] Hold your fire.

409
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,801
We don't know he'll attack.

410
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,603
He will if you keep those guns on him.

411
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,668
Now I want him dead more than anybody,
but unless this is a fight that you know

412
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,479
that you can win,
for God's sake, stand down.

413
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,270
[rumbling]

414
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,325
Stand down.

415
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,785
You can't be serious.

416
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,913
I am.

417
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,581
Stand down.

418
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,877
[Foster] Stand down.

419
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,420
I say again, safe your weapons.
Do not engage.

420
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,632
[creature's heart beating steadily]

421
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,219
Listen.

422
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,797
His heart rate, it's slowing.

423
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,519
[faint growl]

424
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,309
Open the shields.

425
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,483
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

426
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,402
You out of your goddamn mind?

427
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,863
Let him know we're not a threat.

428
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,611
Open the shields.

429
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,541
Do it.

430
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,651
Hey, what's with the light show?

431
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,324
It's an intimidation display.

432
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,165
Like a gorilla pounding his chest.

433
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,083
[Sam] Consider us very

434
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,498
intimidated.

435
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,377
I don't think it's for us.

436
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,678
What are you doing, dude?

437
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,191
[faint bellowing]

438
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,790
[all sigh with relief]

439
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,367
[Sam] Well, that was interesting.

440
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,756
Jesus!

441
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,260
Can we maybe close the shield now?

442
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,181
Show me his territorial routes.

443
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,391
What? Why?

444
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,646
Because I wanna start a boat tour.
Just show me.

445
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,936
[Rick typing] Okay. Coming up.

446
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,942
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

447
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,954
[Mark] When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

448
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,762
it's usually because it's threatened
by something.

449
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,786
Run a course projection.

450
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,862
[Mark] We gotta go after him.

451
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,788
He's looking for something out there.

452
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,999
It could be the ORCA.

453
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,629
Dr. Stanton, what's your projection?

454
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,459
[Rick] All paths have him landing
in the same place.

455
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,301
Antarctica.

456
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,678
Good, then.

457
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,677
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

458
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,765
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

459
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,764
Barnes, contact the <i>Argo.</i>

460
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,478
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,823
[Dr. Graham] The specimen at this site
has been kept entirely off-book.

462
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,455
And since it's a more recent discovery,
our data is limited.

463
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,001
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

464
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,582
Emma called it Monster Zero.

465
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,176
[Dr. Graham] It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

466
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,720
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

467
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,009
Dr. Chen?

468
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,758
I've been scouring
through thousands of years

469
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,309
of myths and legends.

470
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,522
But it's almost as if people were scared
to even write about it.

471
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,641
As if it was meant to be forgotten.

472
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,523
Sorry, I hate to crash a party,
but I got some bad news.

473
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,361
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

474
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,490
We lost Godzilla.

475
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,440
He dropped off the scan near Venezuela.

476
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,449
Dropped off?

477
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,055
I'm telling you, Dr. Brooks was right.

478
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,195
It's a Hollow Earth.

479
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,364
That's how he moves around so fast,

480
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,583
using these underwater tunnels

she pulled that trigger.

647
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,286
All due respect, Colonel, you saw wrong.

648
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,749
Okay? She wouldn't have done it.

649
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,369
Christ, she recruited
pretty much everyone in this room.

650
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,667
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

651
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,794
Maybe he used Madison as leverage.

652
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,153
No, no. It had to be someone else.

653
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,177
[Mark] Emma.

654
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,133
It was Emma.

655
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,095
Foster saw it right.

656
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,476
It was her. No one forced her to.

657
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,720
Are you sure?

658
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,598
[Foster] First, she releases Mothra.

659
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,475
And now Monster Zero.

660
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,107
Anyone else sensing a pattern here?

661
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,779
[Dr. Chen] Yes, and not a good one.

662
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,448
It's as if she is trying
to start a mass awakening.

663
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,818
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

664
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,472
to warn you that that was gonna happen.

665
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,994
Hang on, guys. Why the hell
would she want to release them?

666
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,577
And why would she team up with Jonah,
of all people, to do it?

667
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,713
We'll ask her

668
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,630
when we find her.

669
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,963
So, let's keep looking.

670
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,045
[Foster] <i>Godzilla appears
to be following</i>

671
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,106
the same path as Emma's osprey,

672
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,529
heading north
over South America to here.

673
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,483
Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara, Mexico.

674
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,489
We touch down there in 10 minutes.

675
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,072
[Mark] What about the people?

676
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,748
I'm sorry?

677
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,199
The people. The people
down there in that village

678
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,655
that don't realize they're gonna be
the special of the day.

679
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,170
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

680
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,985
[Officer Arvin] Dr. Serizawa,
we have a call on the emergency channel

681
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,090
from Isla de Mara.

682
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,218
Answer it.

683
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,685
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

684
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,479
Where's Madison?

685
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,487
<i>- She's right here with me.
- Dad, are you okay?</i>

686
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,813
Madison, you all right, hon?

687
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,903
[Madison] <i>Dad...</i>

688
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,563
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

689
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,397
You don't need to be...

690
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,653
[Emma] <i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

691
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,950
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

692
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,819
She's fine, Mark, trust me.

693
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,496
[Foster] <i>Trust is a little hard
to come by, Dr. Russell.</i>

694
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,240
Especially after what you pulled.

695
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,334
[Emma] <i>I know.</i>

696
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,003
And I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

697
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,708
<i>But if there were any other way
to do this, I would.</i>

698
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,421
Do what, Emma?

699
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,261
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

700
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,598
But by releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

701
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,391
<i>As impossible as it seems, it does.</i>

702
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,970
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

703
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:25,275
<i>After we lost Andrew, I swore his death
would not be in vain.</i>

704
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:29,446
<i>That I would find an answer. A solution
to why the Titans were rising.</i>

705
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:34,823
<i>But as I dug deeper, I realized
that they were here for a reason.</i>

706
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,247
<i>And that despite all the years
that we spent trying to stop them,</i>

707
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,416
<i>we never dared to confront the truth.</i>

708
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,460
Which truth?

709
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,381
Humans have been the dominant species
for thousands of years,

710
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,832
and look what's happened.

711
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,838
Overpopulation,

712
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,679
<i>pollution, war.</i>

713
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,059
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

714
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,602
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

715
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,852
<i>We are the infection.</i>

716
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,146
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

717
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,525
<i>the Earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

718
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:15,655
<i>Its original and rightful rulers,
the Titans.</i>

719
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,704
<i>They are part
of the Earth's natural defense system.</i>

720
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,625
<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

721
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:28,122
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

722
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,922
<i>or use them for war,</i>

723
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,009
<i>the human infection
will only continue to spread.</i>

724
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:38,932
<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

725
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,683
<i>and so will we.</i>

726
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,683
Unless we restore balance.

727
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,265
[Rick] <i>And what's gonna be left,
if you do this?</i>

728
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,692
<i>A dead, charred world,
overrun by monsters?</i>

729
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,896
No, Dr. Stanton, the exact opposite.

730
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,983
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil,</i>

731
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,739
<i>or how a volcano creates new land,</i>

732
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,367
<i>we have seen signs that these creatures
will do the same.</i>

733
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,166
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

734
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,787
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

735
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,507
<i>They are the only thing that can reverse
the destruction that we started.</i>

736
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:17,008
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

737
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,052
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

738
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,641
You are murdering the world.

739
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,638
[Emma] <i>No.</i>

740
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:28,315
<i>Because as difficult as this will be,
I promise humanity will not go extinct.</i>

741
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,186
<i>Using the ORCA,
we will return to a natural order.</i>

742
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,944
<i>A forgotten order, where we coexisted
in balance with the Titans.</i>

743
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,862
<i>The first gods.</i>

744
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,111
This is a dangerous path.

745
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,948
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

746
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,999
Gambling with the lives of billions!

747
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,993
<i>And what are you
gambling with, Serizawa?</i>

748
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,454
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

749
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,915
<i>It's on the verge of being shut down
by a government</i>

750
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,421
<i>whose only objective
is to eradicate the creatures.</i>

751
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,345
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

752
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,304
You are out of your goddamn mind!

753
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,152
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger</i>

754
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,538
<i>and now you get to decide the fate
of the world. That's rich, Emma!</i>

755
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,602
<i>I couldn't be more sane,
and Madison couldn't be stronger.</i>

756
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,650
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

757
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,190
<i>And at least now,
she will have a fighting chance.</i>

758
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,897
A fighting chance?
Why don't you listen to yourself?

759
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,616
<i>It's not all math, Emma.
Some things, you can't control.</i>

760
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,304
[voice breaks] <i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

761
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,074
This won't bring him back to us.

762
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,182
<i>I can only urge you all to take refuge.</i>

763
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,851
<i>Over the last 60 years, Monarch has
prepared bunkers around the world</i>

764
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,932
<i>to save and restart civilization.</i>

765
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:54,355
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

766
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:02,985
That bitch.

767
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,112
How long until this thing lands?

768
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,950
Three minutes.

769
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,560
[Rick] You might want to rethink that.

770
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,584
[Foster] Why?

771
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,584
Something's not right. Check this out.

772
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,673
Emma's not at Isla de Mara. I mean,
the signal's too weak to be local.

773
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,541
She's bouncing it off our satellites.

774
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,753
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

775
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,595
She could be anywhere.

776
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,513
- [alarm beeping]
- What is that?

777
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,268
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

778
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,312
How much time do we have?

779
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,399
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

780
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,366
- Hmm.
- [Winston] Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

781
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,612
Doctor?

782
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,998
[Madison] Mom, don't!

783
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,622
I'm sorry, did a child just tell you
what to do?

784
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,548
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

785
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,128
By all means, Dr. Russell,
let's reconsider our entire plan.

786
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,346
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

787
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,632
Madison, we talked about this.

788
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,287
No, you said you were gonna help people,
that you would let them find shelter...

789
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,769
We don't have time for this!

790
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,722
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

791
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,274
Painless? Is that what you told her?

792
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,922
- Leave her out of this.
- [Jonah] Why?

793
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,860
You're the one who pulled her into it.

794
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,531
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

795
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,199
Some grand utopia?

796
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,278
Man and monster,
living together in blissful harmony?

797
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,432
- [alarm beeps]
- [Winston] Sir,

798
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,816
they're attempting to lock us out.

799

01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,086
He's gone.

961
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,499
Looks like you got your wish, Mark.

969
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,799
[Jonah] I thought we were going
to release them gradually.

970
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,051
One at a time.

971
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,266
I'm not the one doing this.

972
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,691
Long live the king.

973
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,281
[people clamoring on monitors]

974
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,784
You're a monster.

01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,499
[shouting continues]

976
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,906
[Officer Martin] <i>Castle Bravo,
this is Containment Team Mosura.</i>

978
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,327
- Castle Bravo, this is Containment Team.
- [Dr. Brooks] Anything?

979
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,262
Dr. Brooks.

980
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,184
We've lost contact with the <i>Argo,</i>

981
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,103
Castle Bravo
and the other containment sites.

982
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,353
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

983
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,185
All the Titans, they're escaping.

<i>Repeat, this may be our last comm.</i>

[Dr. Brooks] Wait, wait, wait.

986
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,533
It's him.

987
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,327
He's the one doing this.

988
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,155
They're responding to his call.

989

[thunder crashes]

990
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,033
Oh, God!
Where's Dr. Ling?

991
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,749
She's outside.

992
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,834
Dr. Ling!
We've lost contact with Monarch.

993

Dr. Ling?

- [Emma] Madison, wait!
- [Madison] Get away from me!

1001
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,255
Look, I know things haven't gone exactly
according to plan, but I can fix this.

1002
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,966
According to plan?
You said that you were gonna be careful.

1003
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,572
That you'd release them one at a time,
that you would restore balance!

1004
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,658
They were gonna take over Monarch
and kill the Titans.

1005
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:46,682
I didn't have a choice.

1006
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,223
Bullshit!

1007
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,014
You said we were doing this for Andrew.

1008
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,896
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

1009
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:07,822
[sniffles]

1010
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,283
Exactly.

1011
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:16,873
Madison!

1012
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,830
[knocking at door]

1013
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,131
[Emma] Madison!

1014
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,558
[Dr. Chen] Any luck?

1015
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,765
No.

1016
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,691
Whatever Emma used to create
the ORCA signal, I've never heard it.

1017
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,522
How are you doing?

1018
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,856
[speaking Mandarin]

1019
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,576
How's that?

1020
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,068
[in English]
"Myth is our compass."

1021
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,454
It's something my mom used to say.

1022
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,704
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

1023
01:10:55,793 --> 01:11:00,003
could help us find the Titans
and restore our connection to nature.

1024
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,877
[Mark] Wait, your mother?
You're second-generation Monarch?

1025
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,125
Third.

1026
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,548
It runs in the family.

1027
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,470
[Mark] That's incredible.

1028
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,276
I don't suppose your family has any tips
on slaying dragons, do they?

1029
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,180
Slaying dragons is a Western concept.

1030
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,182
In the East, they are sacred.

1031
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,936
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength...

1032
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,442
even redemption.

1033
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,194
[Foster] This oxygen destroyer,
why wasn't Monster Zero affected?

1034
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,429
[Barnes] I mean, I'm no scientist,
but I think it has something to do

1035
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,160
with his goddamn head growing back.

1036
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,862
Well, I've never seen anything like it.

1037
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,664
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

1038
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,456
Unless he's not part
of the natural order.

1039
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,376
What do you mean?

1040
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,713
I was able to piece this together.

1041
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,635
[Sam] Well, he looks vaguely familiar.

1042
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,383
[Dr. Chen] It tells of a great dragon
who fell from the stars.

1043
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:55,308
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

1044
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,517
What, you mean an alien?

1045
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,472
[Dr. Chen] Yes.
He's not part of our natural order.

1046
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,314
And he's not meant to be here.

1047
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,183
A false king.

1048
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,435
An invasive species.

1049
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,438
That could explain how he's creating
these massive storms

1050
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,649
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

1051
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,906
It's almost like he's reshaping
the planet to his own liking.

1052
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,699
These legends, what did they call him?

1053
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:18,115
Ghidorah. "The one who is many."

1054
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,966
- Ghi-what?
- She's saying it's like gonorrhea.

1055
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,995
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

1056
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,547
Dr. Serizawa,
we're approaching Castle Bravo...

1057
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,670
but there's something you should see.

1058
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,251
[beeping]

1059
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,837
[thunder rumbling]

1060
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,093
[Mark] I'm guessing
you weren't expecting these guys.

1061
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,803
[Admiral Stenz]
Moscow, London, Washington, D.C.,

1062
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,809
all under attack.

1063
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,566
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

1064
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,645
earthquakes, wildfires, tsunamis

1065
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,230
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

1066
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,032
Now as before, we have been trying

1067
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,076
to lure the creatures
with nuclear materials,

1068
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,074
but they are not taking
the bait this time.

1069
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,491
Their behavior has become random.

1070
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,416
Erratic.

1071
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,503
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

1072
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,582
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded

1073
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,211
we are running out of options...

1074
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,088
and time.

1075
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,132
Excuse me, do you have something to add?

1076
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,763
Yeah. You're wrong.

1077
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,309
Their behavior is not random or erratic.

1078
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,437
If I may, sir.

1079
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,059
As amazing as this sounds,

1080
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,682
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

1081
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,940
All packs, from wolves to killer whales,

1082
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,488
they all respond directly to an alpha.

1083
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,152
And this Ghidorah is the new alpha.

1084
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,697
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

1085
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,448
They're an extension of him.

1086
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,740
We stop him, we stop them all.

1087
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,664
Is there another creature
that might stand a chance against him?

1088
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,754
[Serizawa] No.

1089
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:49,461
Ghidorah and <i>Gojira's</i> rivalry
was ancient and unique.

1090
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,294
Right, so we killed our best shot
at beating this thing?

1091
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,760
[Emma] <i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

1092
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,262
<i>With Godzilla gone,
Monster Zero isn't using the Titans</i>

1093
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,225
to restore the planet.

1094
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,429
He is using them to destroy it.

1095
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,356
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

1096
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,396
Listen, while you
were sitting comfortably

1097
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:09,727
in some laboratory,

1098
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,981
we've been fighting for decades
in one dirty war after another.

1099
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,237
I've seen human nature firsthand,

1100
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,535
and I'm here to tell you
that it doesn't get any better.

1101
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,953
It just gets worse.

1102
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:24,575
So, I'm sorry that Monster Zero
isn't exactly what we were expecting.

1103
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:30,084
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

1104
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,419
- Maybe there is.
- [Jonah] Oh, don't be stupid.

1105
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:39,302
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

1106
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,759
[Emma] These creatures communicate
like whales, okay?

1107
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,094
[on speaker] <i>They can hear sonar
for thousands of miles,</i>

1108
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,604
<i>so let's send a team.</i>

1109
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,683
<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA from Fenway.</i>

1110
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,312
<i>It's just a few miles from here.</i>

1111
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,779
I could use the stadium to amplify
a signal that might stop these attacks.

1112
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,524
<i>The city's already being evacuated,
so it'll be safe.</i>

1113
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,660
[Jonah] <i>And then what?</i>

1114
01:14:58,703 --> 01:14:59,944

1273
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,531
<i>sift through the debris of leveled homes</i>

1274
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,598
<i>in the hope of finding

1275
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,645

it is unfortunately nothing unique.</i>

<i>"The Rise of the Titans."</i>

1279
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,362
I think we should stop.

1280
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,494
Why?

1281
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,911
[Rick] 'Cause I still wanna have kids
one day.

1282
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:53,205
Preferably without flippers.

1283
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,581
[Commander Crane] All stop.

1284
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,746
Hover the ship.

1285
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,301
[Rick] Whoa.

1286
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,260
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

1287
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,637
It looks like there's
some sort of air pocket in there.

1288

[whirring]

- And good night, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

1291
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,199
- [Rick] Yup.
- [Serizawa] There.

1292
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,872
The source of the radiation.

1293
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,665
[Dr. Chen] That's why he returned here.

1294
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,785
He's feeding...

1295
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,495
regenerating.

1296
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,206
This is his home.

1297
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,343
This is how he's survived for so long.

1298
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,339
Always adapting, evolving.

1299
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,761
- It's incredible.
- [Rick] So...

1300
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,555
dude's got this covered.

1301
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,473
Right? He just needs a little nap.

1302
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:57,394
[Dr. Chen] No.

1303
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,388
This process could take years.

1304
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,935
We have to proceed as planned.

1305
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,308
Hang on.

1306
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:07,193
We're gonna launch a nuclear torpedo
in order to revive a giant monster.

1307
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,571
Okay, this is not like
we're just jump-starting a car.

1308
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,138
[Commander Crane]
We have another complication.

1309
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,030
Our weapons systems were damaged
during the crash.

1310
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,285
- We can't launch.
- Can it be repaired?

1311
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:18,918
I'm afraid not.

1312
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,958
[Dr. Chen] Okay.
What if we go inside, set a timer,

1313
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,580
and blow up the warhead manually?

1314
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:28,338
No way. If the heat doesn't fry you,
the radiation will.

1315
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,881
[sighs]

1316
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,890

What the hell does that mean?

1318
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,890
- There must be another way.
- There's no time for debate.

1319
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,764
I'll go.

Sam, what've we got going on?

1390
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:52,736
[Sam] We think Emma activated the ORCA
somewhere near Boston.

1391
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,359
That's why Ghidorah and Godzilla
are both headed that way now.

1392
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,987
But we haven't been able to pinpoint
the exact location

1393
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,947
without the missing piece
of the ORCA signal.

1394
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,121
I've got the missing piece.

1395
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,854
- [high-pitched pulsating]
- [Sam] It's Godzilla, right?

1396
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,718
- I know we already tried.
- It's not Godzilla.

1397
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,543
- It's us.
- What do you mean "us"?

1398
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:11,341
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

1399
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,210
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

1400
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:15,344
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

1401
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,296
[Rick] Well, that makes sense.

1402
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,594
I mean, we are a bunch of
horny murderous carnivores.

1403
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,095
Yeah, that's real poetic. Now what?

1404
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,182
We track it, we find it,
and we get my daughter back.

1405
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,889
What about Moe, Larry,
and Curly over here?

1406
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,975
Godzilla will bring balance.

1407
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:32,439
Oh, I get it.
A little Serizawa let-'em-fight action.

1408
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:33,972
I used to love it when he said that.

1409
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,612
No. This time, we join the fight.

01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:44,228
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

1413
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,539
- I'm getting Maddie back.
- Not with my men, you're not.

1414
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,293
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

1415
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,841
That the planet deserved a clean slate.

1416
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:53,758
But now you're prepared

1417
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,633
to put all our lives in danger
because your little girl is missing.

1418
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,097
- The ORCA is with...
- [Jonah] The ORCA no longer matters.

1419
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:01,933
Man does not control the laws of nature.

1420
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:04,853
And neither do you.

Let her go.

1425
